## Introduction

If you are using the [Yocto Project], you certainly have encountered the hassle
of managing multiple [layers] and tracking their revisions.

I've been using the [Yocto Project] for nearly 3 years by now and have mostly
been using the tool
for this purpose. While I'm not a huge fan of it, it is relatively simple to
use and gets the job of fetching layers and controlling their revisions done
properly.

The only alternative I knew so far was the
[combo-layer](https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Combo-layer), although it's
feature set was not enough for me to give up on [repo] and switch over.

## Using kas with Yocto Project

According to the
[git history](https://github.com/siemens/kas/commit/daf0abab5e0c61d81eee1c6ad69a8040adc2c1870l),
the first public release of the project was at the Jun 14, 2017. I haven't
heard much about it. From my perspective, it gained some traction a couple of
months ago - I've been seeing some mentions of the [kas] tool here and there on
the various [Yocto Project] related mailing lists since then.

It seems to be a little bit more than just a tool for fetching and checking out
a set of layers to given revisions. The feature set covers:

* clone and checkout `bitbake` layers,
* create default `bitbake` settings (machine, distro etc.),
* launch minimal build environment, reducing the risk of host contamination
  (`docker` container),
* initiate `bitbake` build process.

So far, we've mostly been doing the above with a mixture of the [repo], our
[yocto-docker] container and a set of shell scripts to automate things. It
seems most of it can already be achieved using [kas], as it has been developed
specifically for managing and configuring the `bitbake` based projects.

## Installation

According to the [kas usage documentation], it can be installed natively via
`pip` (`python3` is required) or can be run inside `docker` container. I prefer
the latter whenever possible, so I'm going to start with this one.

There are actually
[two containers available](https://hub.docker.com/u/kasproject):

* [kasproject/kas] - for standard [Yocto Project] builds,
* [kasproject/kas-isar] - for [isar] builds.

Although in this case we are interested in the [kasproject/kas] container, I am
happy to see the [kasproject/kas-isar] to be present, as we already have some
use-cases for the [isar] project as well.

Although not mentioned in the
[usage documentation](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/0.19.0/userguide.html#usage),
[it is advised](https://github.com/siemens/kas/pull/6#issuecomment-448166242)
to use the `kas` via the
[kas-docker](https://github.com/siemens/kas/blob/master/kas-docker) script.
For convenience, I'm placing it in my `~/bin` directory, so it is available in
the `PATH`:

```
ln -s /storage/projects/kas/kas-docker ~/bin/kas-docker
```

## kas configuration

The `kas` file syntax and the project configuration process is nicely described
int the
[kas project configuration documentation].

An even better way of understanding it may be to take a look at some real
examples. I can advise taking a look at the
[kas.yml from the meta-iot2000](https://github.com/siemens/meta-iot2000/blob/master/meta-iot2000-bsp/kas.yml).

## Transition from repo manifest to kas file

As mentioned earlier, I've been using [repo] to manage the layers and some
sample configuration files and a set of shell scripts to manage the build
configurations. In the case of [kas], all of it can be included in a single
`kas` file.

### Yocto layers in repo manifest

The [repo] manifest contains a list of layers to fetch and their revisions. For
example:

```
    <project path="poky"
     name="poky"
     remote="yocto"
     revision="rocko"/>

    <project path="poky/meta-openembedded"
      name="openembedded/meta-openembedded"
      remote="github"
      revision="rocko"/>

    <project path="poky/meta-sunxi"
      name="linux-sunxi/meta-sunxi"
      remote="github"
      revision="rocko"/>

    <project path="poky/meta-rte"
      name="3mdeb_rte/meta-rte"
      remote="gitlab"
      revision="refs/tags/v0.4.1"/>

    <project path="poky/meta-swupdate"
     name="sbabic/meta-swupdate"
     remote="github"
     revision="rocko"/>
```

Additionally, we needed an example `bblayers.conf` file or some kind of shell
script to enable the layers we need and adjust the paths to given build
environment.

### Yocto layers in kas file

The equivalent excerpt from the `kas` file would look like:

```
repos:
  # This repo contains the kas.yml file - there is no need to fetch it again.
  # It's current revision will be used to perform the build.
  meta-rte:

  poky:
    url: https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
    refspec: 623b77885051174d0e05198843e739110977bd18
    layers:
      meta:
      meta-poky:
      meta-yocto-bsp:

  meta-sunxi:
    url: https://github.com/linux-sunxi/meta-sunxi
    refspec: 29b20da5e8cdea846c26d47a930d16114d71e0ca

  meta-openembedded:
    url: http://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
    refspec: 8760facba1bceb299b3613b8955621ddaa3d4c3f
    layers:
      meta-oe:
      meta-python:
      meta-networking:

  meta-swupdate:
    url: https://github.com/sbabic/meta-swupdate
    refspec: f2d65d87485ada5a2d3a744fd7b9e46ec7e6b9f2
```

Note that it not only tells which repositories to fetch and which revisions to
use. Based on the above information, `kas` will also automatically generate the
[bblayers.conf]() file with the required layers enabled there.

## Transition from shell scripts to kas file

### Build configuration in sample files and shell scripts

It is quite a common practice to ship some kind of sane, example build config
file (i.e. [local.conf]() file) when providing the `Yocto BSP`. Sometimes,
when some conditional logic is necessary, shell scripts are being incorporated
to modify the configuration files based on the user input.

### Build configuration in kas file

All configurations can be maintained in a single `kas` file. In more complicated
examples, it can be maintained in a set of `kas` files by using the
[include feature](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/0.19.0/userguide.html#including-in-tree-configuration-files).

#### bblayers.conf

This will be at the top of the [bblayers.conf] file. Refer to the
[kas project configuration documentation] for `_header` directive explanation.

```
bblayers_conf_header:
  standard: |
    POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION = "2"
    BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
    BBFILES ?= ""
```

#### local.conf

This will be at the top of the [local.conf] file. Refer to the
[kas project configuration documentation] for `_header` directive explanation.

```
local_conf_header:
  standard: |
    CONF_VERSION = "1"
    PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"
    SDKMACHINE = "x86_64"
    USER_CLASSES = "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"
    PATCHRESOLVE = "noop"
  debug-tweaks: |
    EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"
  diskmon: |
    BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "\
        STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G,100K \
        STOPTASKS,${DL_DIR},1G,100K \
        STOPTASKS,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K \
        STOPTASKS,/tmp,100M,100K \
        ABORT,${TMPDIR},100M,1K \
        ABORT,${DL_DIR},100M,1K \
        ABORT,${SSTATE_DIR},100M,1K \AC
        ABORT,/tmp,10M,1K"
```

#### MACHINE and DISTRO

As you probably know, it is essential to set the set the
[MACHINE](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#var-MACHINE)
and
[DISTRO](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#var-DISTRO).
In `kas` file it is as simple as that:

```
machine: orange-pi-zero
distro: rte
```

#### target

This is the default recipe which will be built during the `kas build` action.
Usually, it will be the main image of our `BSP`. For example:

```
target: core-image-minimal
```

## Usage

It seems that when using `docker` container, we have two modes of operation:

* build the target image with a single command,
* enter system shell and work directly from there.

### Shell

This mode can certainly be useful for debugging (both issues with our `Yocto`
build and `kas` configuration).

Below command will make sure that the repositories specified in the `kas` file
are properly fetched and checked out. Then it will give us access to the
container's system shell.

```
kas-docker shell meta-rte/kas.yml
```

I'm using the `zsh` and faced below error:

```
2019-01-11 14:49:51 - ERROR    - [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/bin/zsh'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/kas/kas.py", line 161, in main

  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/kas/libcmds.py", line 63, in run

  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/kas/shell.py", line 137, in execute

    restore_signals, start_new_session)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.5/subprocess.py", line 1282, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/bin/zsh'
```

It seems that the `kas-docker` script respects our `SHELL` environment
variable. This can be easily overridden with:

```
SHELL=bash kas-docker shell meta-rte/kas.yml
```

### Build Yocto image with kas

The default build can be performed with below command. It will fetch the
required layers, make sure they have desired revisions, modify the configuration
files accordingly and execute the `bitbake` task to build the recipe specified
by the `target` reference in the `kas` configuration file.

```
kas-docker build meta-rte/kas.yml
```

The build output log looks like:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/xJC0QaKuHrMAPhhj5KMZUhMEO.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/xJC0QaKuHrMAPhhj5KMZUhMEO?speed=10)

Note the warning at the top of the log output. Despite using the `aufs` as the
storage driver for `docker`, the `wic` image built well on my setup. The
explanation of the warning can be found in
[this kas commit](https://github.com/siemens/kas/commit/7f1ccba5ea4f1ade36a669c90bbfcffac293edb5#diff-1ef23235cac064dd5e12b4b13bea9e11)

My host setup was:

```
OS: Ubuntu 16.04.1
kernel: 4.15.0-43-generic
docker: 18.09.0
```

## Private repositories

When fetching from private repositories is needed (either during the layers
fetching or during the build process itself), we need to expose access keys
(usually `SSH` keys) somehow. It seems that the preferred way (at least when
using the `kas-docker`) is to use the `-ssh-dir` switch of the script:

```
kas-docker --ssh-dir ~/ssh-keys shell meta-rte/kas.yml
```

The contents of the `~/ssh-keys` can look like:

```
config
github_key_ro
github_key_ro.pub
gitlab_key_ro
gitlab_key_ro.pub
```

And the `~/ssh-keys/config` file:

```
Host gitlab.com
    HostName       gitlab.com
    User           git
    IdentityFile   ~/.ssh/gitlab_key_ro
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Host github.com
    HostName       github.com
    User           git
    IdentityFile   ~/.ssh/github_key_ro
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

## Final example

The final `kas` file for `meta-rte` can be found in the [meta-rte
repository](https://github.com/3mdeb/meta-rte). The documentation on how to
build the system for the [rte](https://3mdeb.com/rte/) using `kas` can be found
in the [meta-rte README](https://github.com/3mdeb/meta-rte/blob/master/README.md).

## Conclusion

After some initial work with the [kas], it seems like a great tool for managing
`bitbake` based `BSP`. It seems that it is capable of replacing most of our
legacy way of managing `bitbake` layers and configuration.

In my opinion, the [kas] project definitely deserves some more popularity. At
the moment it has less than 30 stars on
[github](https://github.com/siemens/kas). I can't wait to see how it would fit
in some more complex use-cases we have.
