### How remote working affects productivity

Since the recent COVID-19 outbreak we all have been forced to pack our tools
along with our potential and switch to home office. One may say that for IT it
is not a milestone; after all our work didnâ€™t change significantly. We can still
develop solutions of an invariably good quality providing that our remote
environment has been fully set. Apart from tools there are more factors,
combined in workflow, of which we are deprived while working remotely for a long
term. Among endless interruptions and no watchful eyes around, with difficulties
to connect people directly, there is the question that rises inside the head:
<b> Ping or not to ping? </b>

Our team was aware of the difficulties made by the current situation. We were
prepared for the necessity of a sudden switch from office to remote work,
treating current situation as a challenge to deepen competences that will allow
us return to the office in a better form. But still, we do agree that this is
not an easy situation to cope with. 3mdeb team, asked for the greatest
difficulties, pointed problem with maintaining work-life balance. We are, after
all surrounded by the household members, with no possibility to change the
environment, even in the form of a short walk. We complain about the problem of
maintaining full concentration among domestic interruptions and feel severely
the lack of direct contact with co-workers; use of messengers extends sometimes
the performance of certain tasks. Fortunately, different situation goes with
motivation among the team. Vast majority estimates their motivation at a high
level. Strong sense of responsibility makes us effectively solve encountered
difficulties.


##### How do we enhance our effectiveness working remotely

We all agree that effectiveness is based on a good planning and detailed goals.
Checklists, detailed notes, to-do lists and smart breaks help us to maintain our
workflow. Some of us effectively use the pomodoro technique, others break the
eight-hour work system by dividing it into smaller parts. During breaks, we try
to leave the computer, spending time with the household members, going out into
the fresh air or doing sports. Responding to encountered difficulties, we adapt
to the current situation, maintaining the good quality of our work. All team
agrees that it will definitely be a positive impact. The current situation
teaches us better work organization, self-discipline and strengthens the sense
of responsibility. It will be undeniably easier for us to stay focused in the
work environment with the colleagues sitting nearby. After such a break, it will
be much easier for us to appreciate the office everyday. What we will miss about
remote working? Surely the flexibility of working hours and the lack of
commuting. Nevertheless, we are all waiting for the end of the pandemic and
quick return to our desks, screens and mugs.
