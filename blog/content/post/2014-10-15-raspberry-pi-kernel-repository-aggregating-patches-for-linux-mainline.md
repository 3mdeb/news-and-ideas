Since several months I'm trying to find my way to embedded Linux programming. My hardware set was very limited I had only one board that can be called "embedded" and it was Raspberry Pi. Because I am more interested in firmware/OS level then hardware I tried to figure out what is going on with RPi kernel. After taking brief review of [raspberrypi/linux][1] GitHub repository I realized that close to my heart is upstreaming effort. So with noob attitude I contacted RPi Upstreaming wiki page author ([notro][2]) and we started to create some foundation. *Disclaimer: These are for testing purposes and considered unstable. Use at your own risk.* *Edit: 20/10/2014:* minor typo, clone instructions moved to "How to use it ?" section 
## What we have now ? We created set of repositories to handle upstreaming process. First there is 

[rpi-dt-linux][3] it is Linux kernel based on [linux-stable][4] with patches on top of every branch. This repository aims to aggregate all patches required for Raspberry Pi support in upstream kernel. `rpi-dt-linux` use `bcm2835_defconfig` with device tree support. We want to introduce every driver that supports device tree. Right now a lot of stuff is missing, but I will dive into it later. After consulting with [popcornmix][5] we decide to rebase all patches to keep them on top of every branch. This of course mean that repository will be broken, but patches will be more visible in history. Second [rpi-dt-firmware][6] is ready to use firmware files for Raspberry Pi with already built modules and kernel. If you are familiar with [Hexxeh][7] [rpi-update][8] and his repository [rpi-firmware][9] this should not be anything new for you. Third [rpi-bcm2835][10] which simplifies build and release process of `rpi-dt-linux`. 
## How to use it ?

## User If you simply want to try new kernel on your RPi then install 

`rpi-update`, by: 
    sudo apt-get install rpi-update
     on Raspbian or follow instruction from 

[Readme.md][8] for other distributions. To install latest release of `rpi-dt-firmware` use `rpi-update` on RPi: 
    sudo REPO_URI=https://github.com/pietrushnic/rpi-dt-firmware rpi-update
     After update simply reboot your Pi and enjoy our upstream kernel :). 

## Developer If you want to play with the code I have few hints that can help. First please clone 

`rpi-dt-linux` and `rpi-bcm2835` mentioned above. 
    git clone https://github.com/pietrushnic/rpi-dt-linux.git
    git clone https://github.com/notro/rpi-bcm2835.git
     Then install 

[rpi-build][11] following instructions on [wiki][12]. Then you can do few things: Build `rpi-dt-linux` locally. This will download latest snapshot of `rpi-dt-linux` and other dependencies like `u-boot` and cross-compiler. 
    cd path/to/rpi-bcm2835
    rpi-build rpi-dt-linux clean build
     You can install already built kernel on your machine over ssh (replace 

`<RPI_IP>` with your Pi IP address): 
    rpi-build rpi-dt-linux install SSHIP=<RPI_IP>
     If you want to use your own kernel repository just use 

`rpi-bcm2835` with local path: 
    RPI_DT_LINUX_LOCAL=../../rpi-dt-linux rpi-build rpi-dt-linux clean build
     NOTE: that additional level of 

`../` was added because rpi-build creates workdir which is reference directory for it. It is also possible to release your own firmware repository. To help with process there are two commands: 
    FW_REPO=/home/pietrushnic/src/rpi-dt-firmware FW_BRANCH=master rpi-build rpi-dt-linux commit
    FW_REPO=/home/pietrushnic/src/rpi-dt-firmware FW_BRANCH=master rpi-build rpi-dt-linux push
     Obviously 

`FW_REPO` is a directory with firmware git repository. 
## Changelog At the point of writing this post there were 3 releases of 

`rpi-dt-firmware`. We applied v10 of [mailbox API][13] and Lubomir Rintel `bcm2835-mbox`, `bcm2835-cpufreq` and `bcm2835-thermal` drivers from his [repository][14]. All updates are published in [README.md][15] with every release. 
## Summary Of course we are happy with every contribution small and big, critique and process improvement hints. Let us know what you think about this effort.
