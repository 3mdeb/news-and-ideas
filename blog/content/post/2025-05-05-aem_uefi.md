This blog post describes the latest phase of TrenchBoot AEM project, which
consists of support for UEFI, as well as some test automation. The history of
this project can be found in previous blog posts ([[1]](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-01-31-trenchboot-aem-for-qubesos/),
[[2]](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-09-27-aem_phase2/), [[3]](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2024/2024-01-12-aem_phase3/),
[[4]](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2024/2024-04-11-aem_phase4/)). There are also
other, more general [posts about TrenchBoot](https://blog.3mdeb.com/tags/trenchboot).

## What's new in TrenchBoot AEM?

Adding support for UEFI installations was the main goal of this part of the
project [funded by NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/TrenchBoot-AEM-UEFI/).
An approach similar to that of Linux (which is currently [being upstreamed](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250421162712.77452-1-ross.philipson@oracle.com/))
was used (the details are below). Even though this isn't how Xen is normally
booted with Qubes OS, it gets the job done.

Second, but not at all less important, objective was to ensure that we don't
break existing implementation for legacy systems. In order to do so, we've
implemented automated tests to catch any misbehavior early, while simultaneously
saving time that we would have to spend installing and reinstalling Qubes OS and
AEM packages. Final bits and pieces are still being polished, but we believe
that this work may be a decent foundation for fully automatic tests in the
future.

The progress was tracked in [this milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/milestone/11?closed=1),
as well as in tasks and issues linked within.

Next sections describe some of the implementation details, as well as history
and rationale for design decisions made along the way. If you're not interested
in those and just want to test AEM for yourself, skip directly to [installation
instructions](#installation-instructions).

## UEFI implementation

There are no significant changes on OS side when it comes to UEFI vs legacy
booting, the only parts that are different are instructions for GRUB
installation, and how `grub.cfg` is created. Users won't even notice the latter,
as this is done automatically on package installation and upgrade.

Main difference is in how Xen is started. Without AEM, Qubes uses Multiboot2
protocol for both legacy and UEFI boot. The only difference is that GRUB for
UEFI parses and handles [EFI boot services tag](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot2/multiboot.html#EFI-boot-services-tag)
within Xen's binary by:

- not terminating UEFI boot services, and passing the information that they
  weren't terminated in Multiboot2 tag
- not passing some of the data that the launched payload is supposed to obtain
  by itself (memory map, among other things)
- using different entry point
- passing UEFI system table and image handle pointers in dedicated MB2 tags

In case of legacy boot, EFI boot services tag in image header is simply ignored,
and GRUB provides all the data a payload may need in MB2 tags. As we can't use
UEFI boot services (they are not measured in the chain rooted in DRTM), we
started by testing what would happen on UEFI if the bootloader simply ignored
this tag if `slaunch` is used. We quickly discovered that Xen ignores some of
MB2 tags and tries to obtain the data "the old way" - by scanning specific
regions of memory in search of some structure.

An example of such structure is ACPI Root System Description Pointer (RSDP),
which points to the rest of ACPI tables. Depending on how the system is booted,
it can be found in one of these ways:

- on legacy BIOS, it is located somewhere in the low memory, which must be
  scanned in search for magic number in the header (this is what Xen on legacy
  does),
- on UEFI, it can be obtained with the help of boot services and system table
  pointer (this is what Xen on UEFI does),
- a copy of RSDP is stored in MB2 tag, and GRUB is responsible for obtaining it
  using one of the above mechanisms, depending on environment (Xen doesn't use
  it).

To address this problem, and probably similar one with SMBIOS later on, it was
decided that a solution similar to what was requested by Linux maintainers for
that system will be used. In that approach, kernel (be it Linux or Xen) is first
started using normal UEFI entry point (so not MB2 in case of Xen), allowed to
get everything it needs from boot services, and then jumps to Slaunch stub
implemented and exposed by GRUB.

This required changes both in GRUB as well as in Xen. Because `chainloader` is
used instead of `multiboot2` command, it also entailed modifications to
`anti-evil-maid` package, which is what is responsible for adding AEM entries in
`grub.cfg`. All of the changes can be found in following PRs:

- GRUB:
  - [#21: Fix calculating MLE size](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/grub/pull/21)

    MLE size reported in OS to SINIT data was being aligned to PMR size
    (2 MiB). If this didn't match the size reported in MLE header, some ACMs
    treated it as an error.

  - [#28: Enable booting of Slaunch-enabled EFI binaries via `chainloader` command](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/grub/pull/28)

    This is the main GRUB implementation PR of current phase. It contains
    bulk of the changes required for making TrenchBoot work with
    `chainloader` command.

  - [#29: v0.5 rc2 updates](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/grub/pull/29)

    We've noticed that PCR values changed between boots. After some
    debugging, this is what we came up with to make the measurements more
    reliable.

  - [#30: Fix AEM for Intel TXT on UEFI platforms](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/grub/pull/30)

    First round of testing exposed some errors in implementation for TXT,
    this PR fixes them.

- Xen:
  - [#21: Slaunch support for Xen.efi](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/21)

    This is the main Xen implementation PR of current phase.

  - [#23: Fix AEM for Intel TXT on UEFI platforms](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/23)

    Complementary PR for GRUB #30, also fixes problems discovered during
    tests.

  - [#24: Fix boot on legacy TXT](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/24)

    When implementing AEM for UEFI, we accidentally broke booting on legacy,
    this PR restores that functionality.

  - [#25: Allow to-be-reserved-mem to be unlisted](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/25)

    During debugging of another problem, various firmware flavours and
    versions were tested. Some of them exposed a corner case on reserving
    TXT-related ranges that we haven't considered earlier.

- Secure Kernel Loader
  - [#21: Update sizes and order of SLRT fields](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/secure-kernel-loader/pull/21)

    Work on TrenchBoot support for Linux included modifications to SLRT,
    which had to be reflected in SKL.

  - [#23: SKL loader amdsl v11 nopsp](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/secure-kernel-loader/pull/23)

    This change (re)enabled booting on older AMD platforms, on which PSP
    isn't involved in SKINIT.

- Qubes Anti Evil Maid
  - [#13: Boot using Xen.efi on EFI systems](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/qubes-antievilmaid/pull/13)

    Change to `anti-evil-maid` package that modifies how entries in
    `grub.cfg` for AEM are created. Previously, `multiboot2` command was
    used to load Xen, the script has been changed to use `chainloader`
    instead.

Xen changes are already being upstreamed, newest set as of writing this blog
post can be found [here](https://lore.kernel.org/xen-devel/cover.1748611041.git.sergii.dmytruk@3mdeb.com/).
GRUB changes [were also sent](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-04/msg00292.html)
as part of series for implementation of TrenchBoot in Linux, but that effort was
put on hold until Linux counterpart gets merged.

You can find an overview of the upstream progress in the GitHub issues:

- [GRUB](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/47)
- [Xen](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/46)

## Testing

Each time new code is added, it should be tested. On top of that, we wanted to
make sure legacy boot still works after adding support for UEFI. Everything had
to be done for both Intel and AMD platforms, for TPM 1.2 and 2.0. This already
gives 8 distinctive configurations, which already is beyond what could be tested
manually in a reasonable amount of time, so automated tests had to be created.

Qubes OS is [tested with openQA](https://openqa.qubes-os.org), so this is what
is used to test AEM. We even reuse existing test that installs the system, to
make sure each of the follow-up steps are started from the same state. [Hardware
setup was described in earlier post](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-12-22-qubesos-hw-testing/),
it was extended to cover more platforms. Some of the steps are specific to
platform, those are described in [our fork of `openqa-tests-qubesos` repository](https://github.com/3mdeb/openqa-tests-qubesos/tree/3mdeb-lab/generalhw).

Since tests are run on platforms that aren't dedicated just for AEM, their
initial state may change between invocations - different OSes may be installed,
which sometimes changes the boot order. To handle this, installation test was
modified to choose proper boot medium automatically, regardless of the default
one.

Writing tests for openQA takes some getting used to, it also requires at least
basic understanding of Perl, because this is the language which openQA uses.
Usually the flow of implementing new test (or part of it) consists of:

- running the test manually, noting _every_ interaction (each key press, mouse
  movement, delay, visual verification of what is displayed)
- writing the notes in test module using [openQA test API](https://open.qa/api/testapi/)
  - key presses become `send_key` or one of the more advanced subroutines like
    `type_string`, `enter_cmd`, `script_run` or even `assert_script_run`,
    depending on expected outcome
  - for raw mouse operations, `mouse_set`, `mouse_click` etc. can be used
  - delays use standard Perl `sleep`, but it is rarely needed
  - video output can be checked by multiple subroutines, most common ones are
    `assert_screen`, `check_screen` and `assert_and_click` - each of those take
    tag as an argument, it must be unique for what it represents, which in most
    cases means a new one has to be used; the screen will be compared against
    so-called needles, they will be created later
- starting the new test using command from one of subdirectories of
  [generalhw](https://github.com/3mdeb/openqa-tests-qubesos/tree/3mdeb-lab/generalhw),
  command for each platform uses different `FLAVOR`
  - one way is to copy new file directly to the worker - not recommended,
    especially if multiple persons can work on tests simultaneously
  - another option is to push it to GitHub repository and start the test with
    [`CASEDIR` and `NEEDLES_DIR` set accordingly](https://open.qa/docs/#_triggering_tests_based_on_an_any_remote_git_refspec_or_open_github_pull_request)
    (remember to use double `%` in `NEEDLES_DIR`, otherwise their preview won't
    work!) - that way fresh tests are cloned to directory specific to given
    platform instead of common one
- open test in web UI and enable developer mode
- wait until it fails on an expected needle, and use the web UI to define it
  - repeat for each new needle
  - test can be continued after the needle is created
- copy new needles (both PNG and JSON files) and commit to the repository
- rerun the test without enabling developer mode to check if it passes

The above process was repeated for each of the defined configurations. In some
cases needles could be reused (e.g. boot selection menu on the same platform
looks identical, regardless of TPM family), but in others they had to be created
from scratch. After gaining some fluency with test API, the first two steps can
be merged together and performed as one.

### Encountered problems

At first, none of the existing needles for Qubes OS matched the output. It was
caused by wrong order of channels (BGR instead of RGB) due to
[a TC358743 bug](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6068). Previously
it was handled by a patch to `ustreamer`, but since version 6.8 of that program
it is possible to pass `--format-swap-rgb` flag to produce output in correct
format. It seems that the newer version is also more stable, old one required
some tests to be restarted to get a valid output.

Trying to run multiple tests simultaneously showed that our initial idea of
extracting ISO and starting the installer over the network didn't work as
expected. With simultaneous execution and bad timing, newer tests overwrote
Kickstart config file before earlier ones were able to consume it. This was
resolved by starting the installation from storage mounted by PiKVM, separately
for each platform. It also made installation slightly faster.

Unfortunately, [SeaBIOS doesn't handle multifunction USB devices](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/1368)
too well - it iterates over all functions, but the loop stops after finding
first supported class (keyboard, mouse or storage). Luckily, the first one
exposed by PiKVM is keyboard, or we would get stuck much earlier. To work around
that, as of now platforms running Dasharo must use regular USB stick with the
installer. HP t630 running its original BIOS doesn't have this problem.

Testing also exposed more issues, both in AEM implementation as well as in
Dasharo, some of them are already fixed:

- [AEM not booting on Intel legacy boot](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/issues/22)
- [UEFI AEM PCR values change between boots](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/55)
- [AEM for UEFI v0.5.0-rc2 doesn't boot on Intel](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/56)
- [Improve TPM event log for AEM](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/57)
- [AEM doesn't work on Dell Optiplex 7010 in UEFI mode](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/issues/58)
- [Firmware preparation instructions](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/1283)
- [Intel TXT doesn't work on VP4670](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/1269)
- [Hangs during microcode update](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/1256)

### Viewing the results

We've created our own instance of openQA at [openqa.3mdeb.com](https://openqa.3mdeb.com/):

[![openQA main page](/img/openqa-main-page.png)](https://openqa.3mdeb.com/)

The results are public and can be browsed by anyone, but new tests can only be
started by few of 3mdeb developers, as it uses platforms in our lab that may be
required in other projects. Navigation through the openQA panel shouldn't be
difficult, but to better understand some of the more hidden features, we've
prepared [user intro documentation](https://trenchboot.org/user-docs/openqa/).

## Installation instructions

> If you're reading this post some time after its publication, the instructions
> may be outdated due to newer package versions. In that case follow steps from
> [the official TrenchBoot documentation](https://trenchboot.org/user-docs/install_aem/).

AEM is installed in a very similar way to previous phases, but some versions are
different, and one of the steps is executed in legacy mode only. Because of
that, only raw instructions are listed below, for explanation of the steps
please refer to [the previous blog post](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2024/2024-04-11-aem_phase4/#installation).
All of the steps are run as root in dom0.

1. Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/aem.repo` with the following content:

    ```ini
    [aem]
    name = Anti Evil Maid based on TrenchBoot
    baseurl = https://dl.3mdeb.com/rpm/QubesOS/r4.2/current/dom0/fc37
    gpgcheck = 1
    gpgkey = https://dl.3mdeb.com/rpm/QubesOS/r4.2/current/dom0/fc37/RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem
    enabled = 1
    ```

2. Download and import signing key:

    ```shell
    qvm-run --pass-io sys-net 'curl -L https://dl.3mdeb.com/rpm/QubesOS/r4.2/current/dom0/fc37/RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem' > RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem
    rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-tb-aem
    ```

3. _Intel only_, download [official package from Intel](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/630744)
   and extract ACM appropriate for your platform to `/boot/`.

4. Install prerequisite packages:

    ```shell
    qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-current-testing \
        oathtool \
        openssl \
        qrencode \
        tpm-extra \
        trousers-changer \
        tpm-tools
    ```

5. Prepare list of AEM packages:

    ```shell
    packages=(
        "anti-evil-maid-4.2.1-1.fc37.x86_64"
        "grub2-common-2.13-1.fc37.noarch"
        "grub2-tools-2.13-1.fc37.x86_64"
        "grub2-tools-extra-2.13-1.fc37.x86_64"
        "grub2-tools-minimal-2.13-1.fc37.x86_64"
        "python3-xen-4.17.5-7.fc37.x86_64"
        "xen-4.17.5-7.fc37.x86_64"
        "xen-hypervisor-4.17.5-7.fc37.x86_64"
        "xen-libs-4.17.5-7.fc37.x86_64"
        "xen-licenses-4.17.5-7.fc37.x86_64"
        "xen-runtime-4.17.5-7.fc37.x86_64"
    )
    ```

    For legacy only:

    ```shell
    packages+=(
        "grub2-pc-2.13-1.fc37.x86_64"
        "grub2-pc-modules-2.13-1.fc37.noarch"
    )
    ```

    For UEFI only:

    ```shell
    packages+=(
        "grub2-efi-x64-2.13-1.fc37.x86_64"
        "grub2-efi-x64-modules-2.13-1.fc37.noarch"
    )
    ```

    For AMD only:

    ```shell
    packages+=(
        "secure-kernel-loader-0+224af56470eff64f2cc1f74c1e1099d3f170636f-1.fc37.x86_64"
    )
    ```

6. Install the packages (first command reinstalls existing packages in case the
   same version numbers exist on official Qubes repositories, second one only
   adds new packages):

    ```shell
    qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem --action=reinstall -y ${packages[@]}
    qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem --action=install -y ${packages[@]}
    ```

7. _Legacy only_, update GRUB (change `sdx` to your disk!):

    ```shell
    grub2-install /dev/sdx
    ```

8. Set up the TPM:

    ```shell
    anti-evil-maid-tpm-setup -z
    ```

    If it complains that the TPM needs to be reset first, reboot, enter BIOS
    setup, search for option to reset the TPM, do it, boot to system and rerun
    this command.

9. Install AEM on boot partition (change `sdxN` to your boot partition!):

    ```shell
    anti-evil-maid-install /dev/sdxN
    ```

    > Boot partition can be obtained with `df --output=source /boot`.

10. Store the secret to be printed by AEM (change it to something only you know):

    ```shell
    echo "really big secret" > /var/lib/anti-evil-maid/aem/secret.txt
    ```

11. Reboot twice and enjoy working AEM.

## Summary

This sums up the work on implementation and testing of AEM on UEFI systems. We
hope that it will be useful to others. It was tested on limited number of
configurations, so there may be issues on other platforms that we weren't able
to catch. In case of any problems, don't hesitate to contact us in
