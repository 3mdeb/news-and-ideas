#### The Importance of test automation

It is common understanding that software, or – in our case – firmware must be
thoroughly tested before releasing it to the public. Without doing that we risk
leaving security vulnerabilities, user-experience destroying bugs and less
optimal performance. While it may seem obvious what should be done, more
specific glimpse proves that there is more than one possible approach to testing
and the choice clearly determines the further results. The question is how
testing should be performed, to provide the most valuable output in the least
amount of time, instead of clumsy and dangerous release. In this blogpost we
will try to narrow down the distinction to the core, as comparing manual and
automated testing. The former is the simpler method and does not add the cost of
writing code, so may be performed immediately. The later is based on long term
thinking about the problem, where scripts perform the tests without human
participation. And let's be clear – such investment into writing comes with many
further benefits.


#### 3mdeb validation approach

How are manual tests different from automated tests? Manual testing is based on
performing the role of a standard user – no code is written. For obvious
reasons, the whole process takes much longer and, although initially it does not
require large investments, results in much lower ROI, due to the costs related
to human resources. In some cases, manual testing is an option worth
considering, for example when performing usability, or in no-scenario tests.
However, in reproducible tasks, like functional tests, only the automation will
bring the expected results.

Our validation infrastructure in 3mdeb consists of ~150 tests. Performing the
whole testing process step by step would take days, especially that the whole
process is repetitive. Summarizing, manual testing in this case costs more and
slows down the whole development pace, when great delay occurs between code
release and feedback for the programmers. If we would still try to test
manually, our knowledge of code quality would be worse and the delivery would be
delayed.

The whole process may be performed in a much more convenient way. Tests can be
run by the developer, who needs only a brief information about the testing
environment. Clear documentation and ready-to-use physical platforms with system
of automatic availability management make it possible to run both, the single
tests and complete suites, concerning a set of functionalities that must be
checked. In result we receive immediate feedback about the changes made and the
features that were added.

#### Remote Testing Environment

As we are performing our test on hardware we had to found a way to automate
management and operations on physical platforms. To meet that goal we have
created Remote Testing Environment - a Orange Pi Zero hat that gives us ability
to remotely control power, simulate pressing of buttons like power on or reset,
read serial output and flash firmware using physical cable connection that can
unbrick device without any manual intervention. This setup has a corresponding
configuration file for every platform model which allow for smooth remote test
execution. Sounds interesting? Try [rte](https://blog.3mdeb.com/tags/rte/) tag

An automated testing infrastructure can be paired with constant integration and
delivery pipeline, to enhance the overall performance. We successfully use such
approach when testing our projects. It all begins when most recent changes for
the release are ready in our core repository and marked as a release candidate.
From this point, the automatic process of building usable binaries begins,
signing it with authenticity proving keys, testing, and delivering the final
product to the customer, as an online ready-to-download file. Because these
time-consuming tasks are performing automatically, it leaves developers more
time for truly creative work on delivering the highest quality of product.

Test verification process needs understanding of the tested functionality and
further interpretation of the results. In case of the automated testing, the
output provides result and definition for getting the necessary information for
users, clients and developers. When the complete regression testing results for
the given release are ready, the next step is to make them accessible and easy
to understand.

#### Why is it so important?

Trust and confidence are critical to the success of a firmware product. There
are two main methods for achieving it: transparency (users can see how the
testing model is performed) and hard validation (users can track how deeply the
product is tested). The greatest result brings joining those two methods.
Publishing the results of hard validation gives the purest quality proof of the
product deliverable. This is how we are performing in 3mdeb, to describe our
products as secure and optimized.

Usually the testing process is ended when the results are made available for
public eyes. We could end this post here as well, but there is something more.
For the analysis it is important, how the tests are presented. Usually the
results are stored in the charts from publicly available spreadsheets, serving
the informing role only. This process can be far improved and automated. This is
exactly what we did. While waiting for our automated tests to be processed, we
have created Dasharo Transparent Validation. System, that automatically presents
the results in a clear way. It has many available filters to customize the view
for presenting the exact data needed, with support for charts embeddable on a
website or repository readme notes. You will hear more about Dasharo Transparent
Validation soon.
