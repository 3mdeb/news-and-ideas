Hello there! This post will introduce some of the very popular attacks that
target electronic devices - the RAM attacks, but the main topic will be the
verification of `ram-wipe` software solution protection from the attacks.

## Introduction to RAM attacks

## ram-wipe

## Testing methodology and tools

As `ram-wipe` is based on setting RAM to zeroes during Linux shutdown or reboot
workflows, to check, whether it succeeded or not the RAM should be checked after
Linux has finished executing. The main problem here is the way the RAM will be
checked. There are two ways: checking the RAM externally, that is, by software
that will not use the wiped RAM for execution (executing software in another RAM
or chip), or by making sure that the software load address and size will be
known, so to be able to conclude what has been overwritten and why some
addresses are not zeroed.

This post will use the second way by executing an EFI application after during
the early device boot stage. Unfortunately, the problem with some EFI structures
being randomly loaded into RAM was not solved, so the checking was done several
times on the same setup to prevent the firmware from affecting the final
results.

The application can be found [here](https://github.com/zarhus/ram-dump-efi). It
is a simple application that runs automatically during boot and dumps specified
RAM range values into files. The application was written as minimalistic as
possible to prevent it from modifying RAM. The only place the RAM could be
modified while executing the application is the dynamic allocation of structures
and variables for writing data to files. This will also be eliminated by running
tests several times.
