### Key Changes in the New Release

Over the past few months, we have been diligently working to address issues
reported by the community and introduce new features to enhance the firmware's
functionality. Here are the critical updates:

## Added

### [MSI FlashBIOS Recovery Support](https://docs.dasharo.com/unified/msi/recovery/#using-msi-flashbios-button)

For coreboot hackers and enthusiasts who are apprehensive about bricking their
hardware while flashing open-source firmware, the MSI FlashBIOS Recovery
Support comes as a reassuring feature. As detailed in our documentation, it
eliminates the risk of a permanent brick, offering a straightforward recovery
pathway in case of BIOS corruption. This feature, demonstrated in the following
video, ensures you can experiment and optimize without the looming fear of
losing your hardware functionality. It's a safety net that encourages
exploration while maintaining system integrity, a boon for the open-source
firmware community.

Of course, that means some microcontroller sitting on the mainboard can read
the filesystem and flash BIOS SPI under certain circumstances and have access
to a specific USB port. That microcontroller does not run open-source firmware
yet and could be leveraged by attackers with the ability to update it or have
physical access. The only reasonable protection for Intel platforms is Intel
Boot Guard with owner keys fused into the chipset, which we deliver as part of
our Dasharo Enterprise offering. If you are interested in Dasharo Enterprise
please [contact us](https://3mdeb.com/contact/).

### Raptor Lake-S CPU Support

We've added support for the Raptor Lake-S CPUs in Dasharo.
This update, highlighted in our [GitHub issue #130](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/130),
is a straightforward response to the tech community's growing interest in the
latest CPUs. It's a simple step to help Dasharo users upgrade smoothly when
they decide so. Thanks to this feature, we stay at the bleeding edge of devices
supported by coreboot.

### MSI ACPI Device and Automatic Driver and Utility Installation Manager

The integration of the MSI ACPI device in Dasharo triggers the automatic driver
and utility installation manager, a feature that promises to simplify the setup
process for users. As demonstrated in the following video, this tool guides
users step-by-step to effortlessly install and set up the necessary drivers and
utilities, removing the hassle of manual installations. It's a practical
addition to Dasharo, aimed at making the initial setup process smoother and
more user-friendly, especially for those taking their first steps in the
open-source firmware environment. It also proves that Dasharo and open-source
firmware is not only for Linux users but can also be leveraged by Windows users
quickly and smoothly without compatibility issues.

### Support for Logo Customization

Dasharo now offers a feature that many users will find delightful - the ability
to customize the logo displayed during the boot process. As outlined in our
[guide](https://docs.dasharo.com/guides/logo-customization/), users can now
replace the existing logo with a design of their choice, adding a personal
touch to their system. Whether it's a fun image, a brand logo, or a personal
design, this feature allows users to infuse their personality into their
firmware, making the boot process a bit more enjoyable and unique to each
individual.

### UEFI 2.8 Errata C Compliance in EDKII Fork

![UEFI Logo](/img/368px-Logo_of_the_UEFI_Forum.svg.png)

In the v1.1.2 update, we've taken steps to align Dasharo with the UEFI 2.8
Errata C specification from January 2021. This is a set of rules that helps the
firmware talk to the operating system more smoothly. It's important to mention
that most of this work is based on the broader community efforts in the
official EDKII code, with a small portion of contributions from our side.

We've included several updates related to capsules, but to be honest, you won't
see the full benefits just yet. We're working on fully supporting UEFI Capsule
Updates in future releases. You can keep an eye on our progress with this
[here](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/423).

One of the good things about moving to a newer specification is that it helps
us tackle some security issues, including problems with variables that haven't
been initialized properly, a concern noted in
[CWE-457](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/457.html). This move makes
Dasharo more secure against certain threats.

But we want to be clear: not all the new features are ready to use straight
away; some of them will need special setup. However, this update lays a solid
groundwork for future enhancements. For instance, it facilitates a smoother
transition to the most recent 2.10 specification, as working with a smaller
diff will make updates easier. It also improves UEFI variables handling, which
can simplify the management and optimization of system settings. Moreover,
users can expect better handling of state changes in the UEFI setup menu,
providing a more intuitive and user-friendly setup environment. Lastly, the
update promises better memory map handling, paving the way for a more stable
system operation by efficiently managing the system's memory resources. This is
all about setting the stage for a safer and more efficient system down the
line.

We've also made some improvements to OPAL password improving error handling in
OpalDriver, what should eliminate some corner case issues.

### Firmware Update Mode Feature

We've been listening to your feedback, and we understand that the firmware
update process can sometimes be too complex, requiring changes to protection
settings in the BIOS setup, including disabling them before performing an
update. As mentioned above we aspire to support the UEFI Capsule Update in the
future, as discussed in [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/423), we acknowledge
that it is a complex and time-consuming feature to implement.

We introduce the Firmware Update Mode in the v1.1.2 release to make your life
easier. When this mode is selected, the platform resets and temporarily
disables all firmware protections, including UEFI Secure Boot, for the duration
of one boot. This initiative aims to streamline the update process for you,
removing the need to unset and reset multiple security options, which can be
tiresome. It's a step towards a simpler, more user-friendly Dasharo experience,
focusing on reducing the hassle involved in the firmware update process.

## Changed

### ME and Microcode Updates: Balancing Stability and Security

At Dasharo, we maintain a cautious approach toward ME updates; while we are
not ardent proponents of frequent ME updates, we acknowledge that they can
sometimes be synonymous with improved stability. Following the silicon vendor
recommendations is a standard practice for us unless there are substantial and
proven concerns that deter us from doing so. For users who perceive ME as a
potential threat, we offer the flexibility to disable it through the setup menu
options, leveraging either the soft method or the HAP bit, thus putting control
back in your hands - [here are
details](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#intel-management-engine-options).

The recent microcode updates bring a host of benefits, with a significant focus
on rectifying the vulnerabilities related to Intel® Software Guard Extensions
(SGX) as well as issues in Xeon Scalable and Atom Processors. Despite those
problems do not affect Alder Lake and Raptor Lake S, which we support in Dasharo,
we decided to include the most recent microcode because of the enhanced CPU
compatibility, promising smoother performance and broader support for various
processors, thereby fostering a more stable and secure operating environment.

## Fixed

### [NVIDIA RTX 3060 HD Audio Device Issue](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/364)

In the previous Dasharo version, people using Dasharo with Windows 11 and a
specific NVIDIA graphics card faced a hiccup - they couldn't get sound to play
through their monitor's speakers. It was a bit of a head-scratcher and
undoubtedly frustrating for those looking forward to enjoying videos, music, or
games with good sound right from their monitor.

With the v1.1.2 release, you can seamlessly use NVIDIA audio functionalities on
Windows 11.

### [Reset to Defaults with F9](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/355)

In a previous release, we encountered a problem where using the F9 key to reset
settings to their defaults in the Dasharo setup menu restored
incorrect settings, disabling several features that should have remained
enabled. We fixed that bug in v1.1.2.

### [Popup Information about Recovery Mode](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/442)

In previous versions of Dasharo, we received a couple reports regarding an
unexpected popup displaying information about recovery mode appearing after
flashing with a valid binary.

This was due to a discrepancy in how recovery reasons were handled during the
boot process, sometimes triggering a recovery mode even with the proper
firmware flash. Addressing this in the v1.1.2 release, Dasharo has enhanced the
firmware's reliability, ensuring that users will not encounter unexpected
recovery popups under normal circumstances, thereby streamlining the boot
process and improving user experience.

### [Watchdog Timeout Value](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/413)

Users reported a problem where changing the chipset watchdog timeout value in
the setup menu did not alter the actual timeout setting; it only updated the
displayed value. This was particularly crucial for systems with a lot of RAM
(e.g., 128GB of DDR5), as the memory training during boot exceeded the default
120-second timeout, leading to a boot loop. Addressing this in the v1.1.2
Dasharo has ensured that users can set a timeout value that
reflects the system behavior, preventing unnecessary boot loops and
facilitating a smoother startup process, especially for systems with
substantial RAM. This fix enhances user control over system settings, promoting
a more reliable and user-friendly environment.

### Setup Password Option

The addition of the Setup Password option in the Dasharo firmware brings an
extra layer of security to your system. It allows users to set a password that
restricts unauthorized access to the firmware setup, ensuring that only
individuals with the correct password can modify the system settings, thereby
safeguarding the system's configuration and enhancing its security.

### Please be cautious when updating the Qubes OS workstation

It was noticed that after the update, there is a need for mechanical power off
(aka [ACPI G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACPI#Global_states)). After
disconnecting the power, please wait until the Ethernet LED stops and then
connect again and power. Without that, just reset or power off/on cycle users
may experience peculiar behavior in Qubes OS like:

* VMs not starting,
* VMs claiming to start (green light in Qubes manager) but nothing on screen,
* space lock (continues space pressed) in dom0 terminal,
* mouse not working,
* flood of NVMe QID timeout in system journal,
* hangs on every command in the dom0 terminal,
* and others.

## Conclusion

Each feature in the v1.1.2 release compatible with MSI PRO Z690-A is crafted
with the user's experience at the forefront, aiming to bring value by enhancing
the reliability, security, and user-friendliness of your system. We invite you
