Our meeting has been attended by ~50 firmware masters from all over the world!

Together with our prominent 3mdeb hosts - Piotr Król and Michał Żygowski - it
was an honour to be visited by such rockstars as Thierry Laurion from [Insurgo][1],
Tom Hiller aka Thrilleratplay, Daniel Maslowski aka CyReVolt, Piotr Kubaj,
Andrew Cooper, Felix Singer, David Hendricks, and many others whom I forgot to
mention (sorry!) - or who preferred to stay anonymous and participate via chat.

We've also had some surprise guests: despite being the relative newcomers to our
cosy community, they have managed to ignite quite an interesting discussion!
Alexey Vazhnov [described][2] how tricky could it be to get merged the coreboot docs,
and we've thought about how to improve this workflow & make this process easier.

In addition to the fresh coreboot forks like heads & oreboot and [new nice GUIs][3],
we've tried to figure out how to promote the coreboot for its official support
by the PC manufacturers - at least for those with new AMD-based motherboards!
And now we know, how we can - even if not "bring a coreboot to every house" -
but to significantly spread its' popularity by wisely doing our joint activism.

Also, we've talked a lot about the open hardware: for example, two attractive
boards from Crowdsupply - [ULX3S][4] and [Qomu][5] - have a small FPGA for which an
opensource toolchain is available. Also, we've explored the firmware freedom in
a "world without x86", [Talos II][6] workstation with a CPU(s) of POWER9 arch, could
POWER10 become as libre as POWER9 regarding the firmware - or would suffer from
the extra binary blob [for D-DIMM RAM support][7] created by Synopsys, and much more!

Someone indeed brought a real beer! - although, for others, a cup of tea was
enough. Our meeting was such interesting and exciting we haven't noticed how
almost 12 hours have passed - "party till the morning!" However, we started
getting sleepy - so decided to have a 2nd vPub the next quarter. You're welcome!
