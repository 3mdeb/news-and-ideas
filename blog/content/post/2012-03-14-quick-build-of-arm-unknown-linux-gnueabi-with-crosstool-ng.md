You might be surprised at how much you have to make to correctly build
`arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi` config based toolchain with [crosstool-ng][1]. As
you can see examples of many open source projects, the man's work is a rare
resource. The result of this economic fact is that the attempt to build
configuration `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi` is not a simple task and during an
operation you can come across many problems. Although I am not afraid of
problems and effectively try to fight them and of course sharing the results of
my work. My build system parameters: `Debian GNU/Linux wheezy/sidÂ 3.2.0-2-amd64`

*   Clone crosstools-ng (you need mercurial)

<pre><code class="bash">hg clone http://crosstool-ng.org/hg/crosstool-ng
</code></pre>

*   Create temporary directory and run

<pre><code class="bash">ct-ng arm-unknown-linux-eabi #choose latest kernel (for me it was 3.2.9)
</code></pre>

*   We probably want to change directory to which all stuff will be build (default is `$HOME/x-tools`):

<pre><code class="bash">ct-ng menuconfig
</code></pre>

And go to:

`Paths and misc options ---> (${HOME}/x-tools/${CT_TARGET}) Prefix directory`

Change it according to your needs. Exit end save configuration.

* Build (number after dot depend on how many command we want to run
simultaneously): `ct-ng build.4` It can take a lot of time. On my machine with
5k BogoMips it takes over 1h.

### Problems that you can encounter:

*   `gcj` - latest changeset `2916:6f758ed4c0b9` have trouble finding `gcj` binary, which it show using following message:

    [ERROR] Missing: 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcj' or 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcj' or 'gcj' : either needed!
     To workaround this install

`gcj` and link binary like this:

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcj-4.6 /usr/bin/gcj

*   `duma` - mentioned changeset also has problem with url to D.U.M.A library, apply below changes to workaround problems:

</code></pre>

*   `mawk` - if mawk return syntax error like this:

    mawk: scripts/gen-sorted.awk: line 19: regular expression compile failed (bad
    class -- [], [^] or [)

It could be fixed in two ways. First is to change `line 19` in
`/path/to/tmp/dir/.build/src/glibc-2.9/scripts/gen-sorted.awk` Is:

    sub(//[^/]+$/, "", subdir);
     Should be:

    sub(//[^/]+$/, "", subdir);

Or simply by installing gawk, reconfigure and recompile `crosstools-ng`. This
was my first post related to linux embedded enviroment. Hope it will be more.
Enjoy!
