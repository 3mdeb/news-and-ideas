### Preface

There are many reasons why ambitious programmers should care about huge rush in
embedded market. IMO there is great potential in it. I don't want to go deep
into this but take a look at all tablets, phones, smart TVs and other cool stuff
like wireless in you washing machine or refrigerator (ok this two are right now
only a gadgets :) ). This is all embedded. Another thing is that wages of
experienced embedded developers are really high. This environment is very
interesting. A lot to learn, a lot to do, so why not get your hands dirty?

### First question: How to start?

To do real embedded development, to learn the most, you simply buy hardware like
all this `${animal}board (animal={panda,beagle,hawk})`. This is the best way but
if you're beginner (like me) you probably don't want to spend $50 for stuff that
you throw away after month because you don't like to deal with it or problems
are not on your level, than maybe you should take a look around and wonder if it
is possible to build virtual environment to check what kind of problem you may
encounter learning embedded ? BTW this is cheap and fun, so potential ROI is big
enough to try. IMHO this is where world going: proof of concept embedded
platforms affordable for common man (not only for US/West Europe), testing
environment based on virtualized/emulated solution, to check basic features,
speed up testing, development and deployment. That's why we see so active
development of software like Qemu/KVM.

### Virtual Development Board - table of contents

I realize that it is achievable and I will learn a lot trying to implement this
idea. Finally I was convinced reading [this][1] two years old article on
[eLinux.org][2]. I decide to divide this article on few parts because IMHO it
was to big to read it at once. Also people interesting in particular topic won't
have to scrolling `>2k` words post. List of all articles in this series:

1. [Qemu as an environment for embedded board emulation][3]
1. [Toolchain for Virtual Development Board][4]
1. [Embedded board bootloader][5]
1. [Linux kernel for embedded system][6]
1. [Qemu network configuration and tftp for Virtual Development Board][7]
1. [Root file system for embedded system][8]

### Kudos

At the and of this intro I want to give big kudos to all those hackers without
whom creating this article would not be possible. Thanks for sharing your
knowledge. Every time when I use knowledge that found by googling I'm trying to
stick link for further reading.
