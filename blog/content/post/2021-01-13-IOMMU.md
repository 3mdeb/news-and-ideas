## Introduction

The I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) is a type of memory management unit (MMU)
that connects a Direct Memory Access (DMA) capable expansion bus to the main
memory. It extends the system architecture by adding support for the
virtualization of memory addresses used by peripheral devices. Additionally, it
provides memory isolation and protection by enabling system software to control
which areas of physical memory an I/O device may access. It also helps filter
and remap interrupts from peripheral devices. Let's have a look at IOMMU
advantages, disadvantages, and how it is implemented from the perspective of
hardware and software.

Advantages of IOMMU usage:

- One single contiguous virtual memory region can be mapped to multiple non-contiguous
physical memory regions. IOMMU can make a non-contiguous memory region appear
contiguous to a device (scatter/gather). Scatter/gather optimizes streaming DMA
performance for the I/O device.
- Memory isolation and protection: device can only access memory regions that
are mapped for it. Hence faulty and/or malicious devices can't corrupt memory.
- Memory isolation allows safe device assignment to a virtual machine without
compromising host and other guest OSes.
- IOMMU enables 32-bit DMA capable devices to access to > 4GB memory.
- Support hardware interrupt remapping. It extends limited hardware interrupts
to software interrupts. Primary uses are the interrupt isolation and translation
between interrupt domains (e.g. IOAPIC vs x2APIC on x86)

Disadvantages of IOMMU usage:

- Latency in dynamic DMA mapping, translation overhead penalty.
- Host software has to maintain in-memory data structures for use by the IOMMU

## In hardware

IOMMU’s architecture is designed to accommodate a variety of system topologies.
There can be multiple IOMMUs located at a variety of places in the system
fabric. It can be placed at bridges inside one bus or at bridges between busses
of the same or different types. In modern systems, IOMMU is commonly integrated
with the PCIe root complex. It connects to the PCIe bus from downstream and to
the system bus (e.g. infinity fabric) from upstream. One example topology is
shown below.

## In software

The IOMMU is configured and controlled via two sets of registers. One in the PCI
configuration space and another set mapped in system address space. Since the
IOMMU appears to OS as a PCI function, it has a capability block in the PCI
configuration space. Additionally, up to eight data structures are placed in the
main system memory. These data structures contain information about the mapping
of interrupts and memory for the usage of peripheral devices. Information about
the device's memory access permissions is stored there too.

## Enabling

IOMMU is a generic name for technologies such VT-d by Intel, AMD-Vi by AMD, TCE
by IBM and SMMU by ARM. Make sure that your CPU supports one of these before you
try to enable IOMMU.

### UEFI/BIOS

First of all, IOMMU has to be initiated by UEFI/BIOS and information about it
has to be passed to the kernel in ACPI tables. For the end-user, that means that
you have to enter the UEFI/BIOS settings and set the IOMMU option to `enabled`.
For readers interested in developing firmware capable of IOMMU initialization,
the next post in this topic will describe the process of enabling IOMMU for PC
Engines apu2 in coreboot.

### Linux kernel

Enable IOMMU support by setting the correct kernel parameter depending on the
type of CPU in use:

- For Intel CPUs (VT-d) set `intel_iommu=on`
- For AMD CPUs (AMD-Vi) set `amd_iommu=on`
- Additionally if you interested in PCIe passthrough set `iommu=pt`

After rebooting, you can check dmesg output to confirm that IOMMU is enabled

On Intel platforms:
```sh
dmesg | grep -i -e DMAR -e IOMMU
```
Output should look somewhat like this:
```

```sh

```

## PCIe Passthrough

One of the most interesting use cases of IOMMU is PCIe Passthrough. With the
help of the IOMMU, it is possible to remap all DMA accesses and interrupts of a
device to a guest virtual machine OS address space, by doing so, the host gives
up complete control of the device to the guest OS. It implicates that the host
doesn’t have to virtualize this device nor translate communication between it
and the guest, this almost completely removes performance overhead and latency
caused by such translations. For example, by performing a passthrough of GPU it
is possible to play games on Windows as a guest OS with performance unnoticeably
different compared to the bare metal Windows. Another frequent use case is
passing through a network interface card to use its full performance on the
guest OS. The obvious drawback would be the inability to use passed devices by
the host or other guests. Some solution to this problem is a technology called
SR-IOV. It allows different virtual machines in a virtual environment to share a
single PCI Express hardware interface, though very few devices support SR-IOV.
It is almost exclusively available in server-grade devices. It is worth noting
that not always IOMMU is capable of isolating a single device. Depending on the
PCIe tree configuration, some devices are inseparable. If it is a case, those
devices will be placed by the kernel in a single IOMMU group. These groups will
be the topic of one of a future post.

## Summary

IOMMU is a useful device with many advantages. Among other things, It protects a
system from DMA attacks and allows better isolation of virtual machines. Its
main disadvantage is the latency of DMA transfers due to the need to check
mapping and permission saved in main memory when the transfer occurs, but this
latency can be largely alleviated by caching that information inside IOMMU. In
summary, the use of IOMMU seems to be beneficial in almost every case.
