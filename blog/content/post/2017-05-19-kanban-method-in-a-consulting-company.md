# Kanban method in a consulting company



Before we start we need to know what is that Kanban. Let me show you a short 
explanation:

> **Kanban** is a method for managing resources necessary for production process
so that everyone produces much as need at a given moment. Work items are 
visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from task 
definition to customer delivery. Team members "pull" work as capacity permits, 
rather than work being "pushed" into the process when requested.

> In software development, Kanban provides a visual process-management system
which aids decision-making about what, when and how much to produce. Although
the method (inspired by the Toyota Production System and lean manufacturing
originated in software development and IT, it may be applied to any professional 
service whose work outcome is intangible rather than physical.

## Tools

The basic work tools are boards and stickers, but in our company we use visual 
boards in [Trello] (https://trello.com/), which streamlines our work in kanban. 
Our arrays are divided into appropriate categories: Backlog, To Do, In Progress,
Verification, Done and Project Status, where we can discuss project features 
or problems.

## Cards (Kanbans)

According to the Kanban method we give out a kanban cards to assigned 
employees. The card is very important in the whole project process. According
to her, we measure our work and set time for each stage in the design, develop
and testing solutions in embedded systems projects. Additionally inside the 
card we can discuss the features and see, what happened since last time.

## Workflow

The card life begins in ToDo, sometimes it happens there we have a lot of big
task and cards with small priority are moved to the Backlog, where they are 
waiting for some free time to solve them. We are trying to minimize transfering
the cards from right to left, our goal is to streamline this process.

## Rules

To make kanban work, each employee must follow these rules:

- [ ] Do not take a lot of tasks,
- [ ] Keep order,
- [ ] Discuss about tasks,
- [ ] Don't race for who will do more - focus on teamwork,
- [ ] When somebody have problem our task is to help each other.

These rules are only a sample but improve the whole process. We know situations 
where tasks is going fast to verification, after which it turns out that the 
task is incomplete and we need turn it back to the left. Good comunication 
helps, what if some feature is expired and we dont know about it? One sentence 
in communication can save much of time. 

## Pros and cons

The advantages are:

- Universal - can be used to visualize company overview, project or employee
individual workflow
- Creating a WIP (Work In Progress) limit - it prevents overproduction and 
quickly detects bottlenecks
- Clarity - one look and you know the whereabouts of the project
- Stream management - systematic time and effort measurement to optimize 
processes.

 And cons:

- Need for continuous control
- Commitment of each employee
- Incorretly managed will turn into a battlefield where employees struggle, who
has done more and create a nasty mess on the work cards. 

## Summary

Kanban is designed for companies where software is deployed and delivered in 
cycles. This choice was very useful in our company. By using it, we increase the 
order in the organization of our tasks and make it easy to find the needed
information by reducing the volume of communication and grouping it into 
individual pages. Now we don't have to look for another tool but maybe in future
we will try to mix some metodologies for better work.
