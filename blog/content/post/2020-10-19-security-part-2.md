The issue of web application security is a topic that is becoming more and more popular. Currently, not only large organizations and corporations, but also smaller and smaller businesses are forced by progress to transfer some of their activities to the Internet. The process has accelerated even more due to the current global pandemic and changes in the way people communicate.

While large business entities have been operating in the realities of application security for a long time, smaller entities have very little or no knowledge of how to adapt to these new, demanding conditions without exposing themselves to business risk. Unfortunately, the risk of operating in digital markets only increases.

Due to increasingly stringent regulations, the loss or disclosure of data has very serious consequences. These can be financial penalties, loss of reputation or customer trust, which ultimately translates into a bad financial result, and in the worst case it will lead to the collapse of the company.

In this situation, it should be emphasized that we, developers, should be responsible for the security of the provided solutions.

### How to deal with security challenges?

The first step is the right approach to the software development process.

There are some rules to follow:

- continuous development of your skills through your own development and training within the organization,
- sharing knowledge about safety in the team,
- taking responsibility for not releasing an underdeveloped product under time pressure,
- good understanding of the impact of risk on the business aspects of operations,
- following external guidelines such a OWASP,
- primarily treating safety as priority, not a necessary evil

The rules are obvious, but how many cases do we really stick to them? In how many cases are we not looking for the best solutions or we do not pay enough attention to tests due to the race against time?

We have to answer these questions ourselves. Being aware of your own approach is the beginning of the road to trying to combine speed and security when developing software.

### What's next? Know your enemy.

Fortunately, the problems we face are similar for all developers and there are organizations that work to describe most of them and teach others how to protect themselves from outside threats. Therefore, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.

##### OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. [OWASP page](https://owasp.org/)

This organization publishes a list of the most common errors in web applications. This list was established in 2017 and is based on real data obtained from companies, organizations and professionals involved in security testing.

##### The current list for 2020:

- Injection
- Broken Authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- XML External Entities (XXE)
- Broken Access control
- Security misconfigurations
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Using Components with known vulnerabilities
- Insufficient logging and monitoring

The list is periodically published and importantly, consists only 10 points. This makes it easy to analyze and understand, making it a good start to taking a serious approach to security in your organization.

A detailed description of each issue can be found in this [article](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2020/) and on the [official website of the organization](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

OWASP list should be included in every software development project.
It is the best set of security requirements and best practices, and most importantly, it works!
Following and implementing the OWASP recommendations has only positive consequences and teaches you to apply the best available practices.

### Summary

In summary, the software company and developers have the greatest impact on online security. It is determined by the right approach and emphasis on security in the produced software, the use of the latest tools, as well as making clients aware of the dangers. Developers must prioritize security, because this is the only way to protect the interests of customers and their own. The amount of regulations imposed on companies operating in the field of IT and e-commerce will only increase. So is the number of attacks and attempts to get into the systems of unauthorized persons.

The sooner we implement the appropriate processes, the sooner we will be ready for future threats and the same our value in the eyes of customers will pay off.
