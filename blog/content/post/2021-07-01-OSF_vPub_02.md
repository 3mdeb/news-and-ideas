![vBeer v2 poster](/img/vbeer_v2_poster.png)

The primary theme of our 2nd OSF vPub (7th May) - was the OSF and OSHW synergy
with OpenISA: in example, we have explored the software freedom of RISC-V
implementations and new devices such as BeagleV. RISC-V is attractive to the
people who aren't satisfied with the software freedom problems of the more
popular architectures such as x86. And it's essential to ensure that this
emerging platform is going in the right way and figure out how can we help.

Among our many close friends from all over the world who found the time to join
us, it was a great honour to be visited by Richard Stallman - who shared lots of
worthy ideas (such as having a roadmap & status pages) to assist the liberation
of RISC-V. Many people (myself included!) were happy to discuss with RMS, - and
we at 3mdeb will try to invite more such prominent guests to our future events.

Also there was a lot of exciting talk about [LibreSOC][1], [ULX3S board][2],
[Chips4Makers][3], [Coriolis][4], [Skywater PDK][5], [Sandsifter][6],
[OpenBook][7], [PowerPC Notebook][8], [Precursor][9],
[Open Security Training][10], [OpenXT][11], [OpenBMC][12], [Pinephone][13] and
many other wonderful projects that can be surely of your interest (please check
the links!). Overall, our gathering was a great opportunity not just to spend a
nice time in a cosy atmosphere, but also to learn more about the open/libre
software, firmware and hardware, - and the security benefits these projects are
bringing to the people.

In addition, we have analyzed the results of our "Ideal platform for coreboot
training" survey. Many people believe that such a platform should be affordable,
developer-friendly (with easy flashing and serial logs gathering), conveniently
small form-factor (preferably without sacrificing the repairability) and not
necessarily x86 considering its limitations and the emerging new architectures.

If you are interested in those topics, or would like to contribute your own
topics for the 3rd vPub (i.e. about your project related to OSF/OSHW/Open ISA):
feel free to reach us out by writing to <contact@3mdeb.com>. And to avoid
missing the next events, [sign up to our newsletter][14] or visit
[3mdeb events calendar][15]. If you would like a live chat, write to @mikebdp2
on Wire messenger - and I will add you to our OSF vPub group.
