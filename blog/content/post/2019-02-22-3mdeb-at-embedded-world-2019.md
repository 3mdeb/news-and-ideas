## 3mdeb at Embedded World 2019

![ew2019-logo](/img/3mdeb-at-ew2019.jpg)

We are excited to inform You that 3mdeb will take part in embedded world
Exhibition & Conference -
[**Embedded World 2019**](https://www.embedded-world.de/en)
next week! In place full of enthusiasts You can meet us personally between
26.02-28.02 in Nuremberg, Germany. Come and talk with us about amazing world of
embedded systems. We will tell You not only about our work and innovations, but
also share our knowledge, help and present to You our products and demos:

- [Remote Testing Environment](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/open-source-hardware/rte/)
  \- Hat designed for Orange Pi Zero board which runs specially crafted Linux
  distribution using the Yocto Project.
- [TPM2.0](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/modules/tpm-2-0/) - a Trusted
  Platform Module is a specialized chip on an endpoint device that stores RSA
  encryption keys specific to the host system for hardware authentication.
- [MuxPi](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/open-source-hardware/muxpi/) - a product
  mainly for developers and testers with the need of automating everyday tasks.
  It comes with help providing ease of use, distribution and connectivity.
- [Bay Trail FastBoot](https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/s/kQdWQDX7gk88aWo) -
  the demo is presenting alternative open source firmware - coreboot - in
  comparison to UEFI implementation on the example of BayTrail platform -
  MinnowBoard Turbot. Additionally, we present how fast can embedded platform
  boot with open source firmware compared to official firmware. The platforms
  are running the same operating system (in UEFI and legacy mode) in multi-user
  target. The chosen distro is lightweight Solus OS. Using common Linux and
  coreboot tools, boot times are presented of both firmware implementations.
- [Bare Metal Hypervisor](https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/s/mfFbiSnCPkzd25d) -
  the demo is presenting one of the features that bare metal hypervisor gives.
  It is run in edk2 UEFI implementation on MinnowBoard Turbot platform.
  Hypervisor was written with Bareflank - an open source hypervisor SDK.
  Depending on the implementation, it can provide an interface for underlying
  software to control hypervisor's operation or be completely transparent. This
  kind of hypervisors use Intel's VMX (Virtual Machine eXtensions).
