as seen in the number of commits, mainly through our work in:

- Mainboard and SoC Support: We added and improved support for Protectli
  mainboards based on Intel Elkhart Lake, Alder Lake SoCs. Added support to dump
  GPIOs on Jasper Lake SoC.
- Documentation: coreboot's documentation was updated, particularly in the
  Dasharo description and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) options.
- TPM Security: New log formats compliant with the 2.0 and 1.2 specs and
  Kconfig-configurable PCR usage.
- VT-d: The VT-d subsystem now has a new DMA protection API, which we integrated
  into Alder Lake's functionality.
- EDK2 Payload: Users can now clone the edk2-platforms repository.
- Bug Fixes: Multiple fixes in different areas, such as Intel Elkhart Lake's
  GPIO and Makefiles.
- Power9: We refactored the code to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Additional features: A speaker beep function and updated USB port macros.
