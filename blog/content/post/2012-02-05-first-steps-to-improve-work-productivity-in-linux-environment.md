The problem encountered on several occasions over several months. Now it is time
to deal with it.

How did this happen? As always, resources were not sufficient,
and if we can not increase the amount of resources we must strive to optimize
their use.In this case, it was about time. While reading my last acquisition,
once again I faced the problem of re-configure Linux account. Every time when I
need new account for some reasons I need to configure some things manually. Most
things are simple enough, we copy configuration files from the already existing
user directory, and voila. Of course Murphy's law works, and something goes
wrong. Sometimes we need to create a new account with just a few of the tools
configured as in other existing accounts.

So we have a problem, however, reflecting on the solution, my mind was deepened
in the increasing number of new issues, which caused the solution became more
distant. How this process looks like? First we need new account, it should get
automatically some configuration files that I create for other accounts.

Second I realize that I don't have methods for storing configs that I use most.
I heard about dotfiles tracking with git with cloud help (e.g. [github][1]).
When I google this issue I found [dotty][2]. But after that I ask myself about
productivity improvements in broad sense and the conclusion was that my work
scheme should be changed. So I try to find some hints about improving
productivity, there are thousand of web pages about that. Few things I found
useful first of all the idea of "automated time tracking". Second that chaos
that I produced during solving simple problem meant that I thought about
controlling of its flow, and this led me to [mind mapping][3] technique. AFAIK
[FreeMind][4] is the best free software for playing with this way of data
presentation. Below I attach my first mind map in FreeMind, this is of course
beta version.
