## Introduction

**NOTE**: Following content was initially edited and published in
[Elektor 10/2018](https://www.elektormagazine.com/magazine/elektor-75/42164).

Every engineer at some point in career wonder about taking everything in her/his
own hands and starting work as an independent freelancer or consultant. When
that thought got to me the first time I was working for a big international
corporation and I was naive enough to think that I can organize things much
better. Sadly there are not many sources where you can read how to start and
navigate through the first year or so. It is hard to not mention here embedded
systems guru Jack Ganssle and his classical
[Guide to Being an Embedded Consultant](http://www.ganssle.com/item/becoming-a-consultant.htm),
which was motivation to me and must-read for anyone thinking about change.

In the following article I describe my path to building Embedded System
Consulting company and problems I faced when building an organization.

I silently assume you have decent experience in embedded systems or related
field and considering a change in your career. Below consideration is rather for
engineers starting solo who would like to know how to start and how the everyday
operation may look like.

## Dream

Reality is usually much different than our expectations. That’s why I recommend
trying things before making the move. Before I made the decision of leaving the
corporate world I worked for over 6 months part-time as a freelancer through
various popular websites. Thanks to that experience I faced all critical parts
of the business that can be new to engineers from embedded systems field:

- Customer relationship - explaining technical things in a non-technical way is
  crucial, helping understand what can and cannot be done
- Project planning and estimation - impossible to learn in theory, requires a
  lot of practice
- Pipeline filling - no new customers means no paycheck next month
- Legal, accounting, marketing

Of course key engineering work have to be done on time despite all problems that
enumerated areas may bring. Overall consultant or freelancer get rid of
corporate processes, but have to build their own to make things stable for a
time longer than a couple of months.

Initially, I thought that it would be possible to avoid processes, but building
business requires solid structures which cannot be destroyed by minor change on
market. It is important to understand Embedded Systems Consulting may bring a
lot of unexpected issues, but if you can navigate and stabilize that kind of a
business reward can be worth the effort.

## From Dream to Action

There are still tons of questions to answer, but most important at this point is
to start work for yourself, what means either paid project from some customer or
project that will help you promote your profile. Key questions that should build
a framework are:

- How much time I can spend on side projects during week/month?
- Does my contract allow working for other people/companies?
- What are the technology areas that are most interesting to me?

The first point you should consult with your family and friends. Amount of time
and hours you working should be clearly defined (e.g. Mon-Fri: 9am-5pm - regular
work, 8pm-midnight - side project). Please note that working 8h in a regular job
and then additional couple hours on side projects, can be exhaustive, so you
should remember about healthy style basics and be reasonable about pushing the
limits. Time management is very important, so make sure you loose as less as
possible in traffic, the ability to work remotely can really help here. If you
work over hours for your current employer you should spend this time on your
side projects.

You should consult your contract with a lawyer, in some states employers cannot
forbid additional professional activity. Some contracts obligate you to ask the
employer for permission, please note that you can be rejected and to proceed you
will have to change your job. Rethinking your tactics twice before talking with
a manager is very important. In any case, you have to avoid conflict of
interest.

There are tons of technologies used in the embedded systems area, so you have to
choose something. My initial idea was to understand all development kits I had
on shelves. It may be worth to look at the market and see which projects are
high value without much attention from freelancers. Also, you can’t be wrong
with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but please note that market for those boards is
huge and rates are very low - unless you do something exceptional. To summarize
please choose technologies that you could work on without being paid for and
start work and document your effort.

## Profile

I think one of the first things, in our digitized reality with hundreds of
social media channels, is building your own profile. There are tons of books
about personal branding and building your Internet presence. Typically at the
beginning we don’t have an idea of the brand and we stick with our own name
around which we building a reputation.

What is important to realize is that there are limits to the size of the project
that a single person can handle, depending on your business experience you may
decide to address that problem at the beginning or wait to cross that bridge
when get there.

### What you need to build a good profile?

- Profile overview - some introduction that would be read by a potential
  customer and give feeling what kind of work she/he may expect from you.

- Sample projects - key rule should be “always document your work” since you
  never know when it can help you gain traction. Pictures and a short
  description of the project with used technologies is something that can drive
  customers. Please note that project documentation is your key marketing
  material - better you can create, better customers you will attract.

- Visibility - it should be easy to find you, make you are available through
  freelancing websites, professional profile website as well as Stack Overflow
  and forums related to your expertise.

A profile containing the above characteristics should be consistent across
various social media and can build a good ground for a personal website. It is
good to consider writing a blog and being active in social media since those are
reasonably inexpensive marketing methods.

## Mechanics

Let’s assume you followed above advices and you prepared your profile and
published it on most important freelance websites. What now?

There are 2 main strategies, either you bid everything that falls in your area
of expertise, either you wait for being invited. You have to master interaction
through given freelancing service and understand all its pros and cons. It is
important to have some badges that prove your skillset as well as earning a
reputation through activity. I was lucky enough to have got most of my project
through direct invitation. Personally, I never bid projects that I was not 100%
sure I can finish below the budget and on time - those projects were typically
things that I accomplished many times and I already had everything solved in my
head.

Sooner or later you should get your first customer. Without going deep in
project management field we can distinguish 3 main project phases: on-boarding,
execution and closing.

On-boarding is the phase where engineers made the most mistakes. Incorrectly
handled relation, lack of process, over-optimistic pricing and delivery dates,
all that give terrible results. That is why I operate using the following rules:

- Always have an introductory call with a new customer - if a customer does not
  have time to talk about the project it is a bad sign.
- Never perform complex project estimates without being paid - typically
  embedded systems projects are complex and analysis take a significant amount
  of time, because of that estimates preparation is project in itself which
  prove the basic concept and feasibility of further activities. I believe this
  point itself could easily take the whole article, but we don’t have space to
  dive deep into it.
- Never provide estimates without having the hardware (or at least development
  board on which target hardware was based) on your desk - we all know-how
  embedded systems development can be surprising: buggy designs, insufficient
  documentation or lack of vendor support, we faced that before. Adding one more
  possible point of failure by committing to a hardware platform that we have no
  hands-on experience is way too much and may easily destroy our brand.
- Be honest about the project idea and what is reasonable with provided
  resources, do not forget to write down limitations - it is easy to enter not
  well defined project, but closing that project without failure and financial
  consequences may be impossible.

Above rules should help in the onboarding process, but then we have the
execution phase. This stage requires correct communication adjusted to customer
needs. Communication is something that most engineers may have a problem with
it: requires patience, understanding and clear mind to address all issues
without causing more problems. Soft-skills is something we may have a problem
with that’s why we should train a lot, always look for solutions, ask more
experienced friends and never give up.

The execution phase is the time when we use our key technical skills. We should
remember that good engineers always take notes and prepare documentation. If we
are serious about our Embedded Systems Consultant career we should never ignore
problems, any limitation should be provided to the customer and clearly
explained. Documentation of operational technology (e.g. how to get, build and
deploy embedded software) for the customer may be even more important, then
correct functions description in header files. We should always improve our
execution by using modern development techniques and efficient tools.

Finally, we have to close the project. If previous phases were addressed
correctly we should have nicely packaged result of our work, that can be
utilized by the consumer without much hassle. I never saw an embedded software
project finished without limitations or things that could be improved. Delivery
of release package is very important because this is a key factor based on which
customer will rate your service. Based on customer rate you may get free
marketing and/or new projects. 3mdeb reports typically contain initial project
scope document, release notes mentioning all features implemented and
limitations, user documentation defining the easiest possible way to utilize
project results, other deliverables like source code or binaries.

## Business Tips

The non-engineering, business side of consulting can seem daunting. But it
doesn't have to be. Here are a few simple tips to keep in mind as you start your
own consulting business:

- Be an engineer. Remember that you are first and foremost an
  engineer/programmer, not an accountant, lawyer, or bookkeeper. Focus on your
  strengths, and don't be afraid to find accounting, bookkeeping, legal, and
  business support early on that is, as soon as you start your consulting
  business. There are plenty of resources online to help you get started. And
  talking one-on-one with a business professional in the early stages of your
  endeavor will make starting and running your consulting business easier than
  trying to troubleshoot problems later down the road while you're working on
  actual engineering-related projects. Freelancing portals typically handle most
  of those problems for you, of course you have to agree to their rates at the
  beginning.

- If you work without third party between you and customer, then use contracts.
  It's important to use written contracts and the Scope of Work/Statement of
  Work (SOW) statements clearly define project or services you will perform.
  Creating the correct project charter is the art in itself and there are online
  courses that can help you do that correctly. In short, make sure both you and
  customers agree upon project/service:

  - Goals
  - Scope and out of scope activities
  - Your and customer responsibilities
  - Requirements - ideally defined using RFC 2119 terminology
  - Execution procedure
  - Deliverables

In addition, you may add assumptions and constraints that you know of as well as
risks related to various project requirements.

## Conclusion

In the above article I just scratched the surface of the real-life of Embedded
Systems Consultant. It is very hard to digest 4 years of experience in one
article, so in some places, you may see simplification and shortcuts. Overall I
covered how your dream may differ from reality, what are the key things to
remember when making move, timing, mechanics and approaches for the transition
between regular engineering position and independent consulting.

## Summary

Overall I think we should understand why we make a move and what difference we
want to bring to the world. If our only motivation is money, then IMO it is not
good enough since we can lose fuel when we will have enough.

In 3mdeb our mission is to make firmware world more open and accessible to
everyone. We believe that a world with an open ecosystem for embedded firmware
development would be better.

Think about your motivation before making a move.
