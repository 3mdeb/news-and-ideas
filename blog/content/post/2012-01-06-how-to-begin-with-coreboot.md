About a month ago I started my adventure with coreboot. As [coreboot home][1]
page says "coreboot is a Free Software project aimed at replacing the
proprietary BIOS (firmware) found in most computers". Although I read the
majority of materials from mentioned page I still suffered from a lack of basic
information that would help me to arrange everything in my head. Therefore, I
decided to write a series of posts described my actions associated with this
interesting project. At the beginning I would recommend some interesting sources
of information on coreboot:

- <http://web.archive.org/web/20240619212654/https://www.coreboot.org/QEMU> - If
  you're impatient and want to start as soon as possible
- [Coreboot videos][2] - One of the easiest ways to obtain general information
  about the project
- [Start to understand][3] - I found this page by accident while googling
  materials, thanks to its author I understood basics and found out what's next
- [Documentation][4] - Many different types of documents, a large proportion of
  them are not applying to the latest version of coreboot v4, however, still has
  a educational value.

After reviewing the above materials, you should understand the basics of
coreboot. In the [next post][5] I will describe [flashrom][6] application and my
experience with one of the old motherboard.
