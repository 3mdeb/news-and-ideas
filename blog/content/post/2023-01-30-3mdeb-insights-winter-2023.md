This blog post will provide an in-depth look at upcoming plans and events for
the near future. In the next quarter, we have several exciting events planned
for the 3mdeb community. Our events aim to provide a platform for members to
connect, share knowledge, and stay informed about the latest developments in
the open-source ecosystem.

## Upcoming events

### FOSDEM 2023

FOSDEM is a large, annual event for open-source software developers that
takes place in Brussels, Belgium on February 4th and 5th. It is an opportunity
for developers from all over the world to come together, share ideas, and
learn about the latest open-source technologies. This year, together with
Daniel Kiper from Oracle, 3mdeb will co-host an "Open Source Firmware, BMC,
and Bootloader Devroom" to showcase their contributions to the open-source
ecosystem and connect with other developers. Additionally, 3mdeb engineers
will be present to share their knowledge with attendees.

[Maciej Pijanowski](https://twitter.com/macpijan) will discuss the
[TwTPM project](https://twpm.dasharo.com/), which aims to increase the
trustworthiness of TPM modules by providing open-source firmware compliant
with TCG PC Client Specification. TPMs enable security features such as
measured boot and verified boot, but the market is dominated by proprietary
firmware. The presentation will detail the project's goals, design,
challenges, and status, also extend the
[existing community](https://matrix.to/#/#twpm:matrix.org), and exchange ideas.

[Tomasz Żyjewski](https://twitter.com/tomzy_0) will provide an overview of
the Secure Boot feature on ARM SoCs, which is a BootROM feature that allows
for the verification of loaded binaries before execution to prevent
untrusted code from running on the platform. This talk is a follow-up to
previous Maciej's FOSDEM talk:
[Overview of Secure Boot state in the ARM-based SoCs](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/tee_arm_secboot/).
The approach is similar across vendors, but the Secure Boot feature on ARM SoCs
has no standardization. We will check the status of the Secure Boot feature
from a year ago and expand on it by describing examples on Rockchip and
Mediatek-based boards. This talk will help developers integrate Secure Boot
into their platforms for increased security in embedded devices.

[Michał Żygowski](https://twitter.com/_miczyg_) will be presenting
the highly-anticipated "AMD Open-Source Firmware Report" at FOSDEM 2023.
This annual talk unofficially referred to as the annual AMD open-source firmware
report from 3mdeb, has long been a tradition in the open-source firmware
community and is eagerly awaited by developers and enthusiasts alike.
This could be confirmed by several Phoronix publications from previous years
([2020](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Coreboot-In-Early-2020),
[2021](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Open-Source-AMD-FW-2021),
[2022](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-OSF-2022)) which covered the event.

During the talk, Michał will reveal the latest updates and developments in
the field of open-source firmware for AMD platforms, including the history
of AMD's cooperation in coreboot projects, and the current state of support
for modern mobile Ryzen chips on Chromebook devices. He will also unveil
a plan for long-term, stable, and sustainable support for older platforms.
Additionally, the talk will highlight the efforts of 3mdeb to support the
AMD platforms and the situation of maintaining PC Engines platforms.
This is a must-attend event for anyone interested in open-source firmware,
BMC, and bootloader development.

### Dasharo User Group (DUG) #1

The Dasharo User Group (DUG) is an important forum for users of Dasharo to
come together, share their knowledge, and stay informed about the latest
developments in the Dasharo ecosystem. The DUG is a platform for users to
connect and learn about new features and updates that are coming to Dasharo.
The first DUG event will take place in early March and will include a variety
of discussions on different topics related to Dasharo. The agenda for the event
will be shared in the next month. The event will be a great opportunity for
Dasharo users to meet other users, learn new things, and share their
knowledge and experience with others.

### Dasharo Developers vPub 0x6

The Dasharo Developers vPub will be a follow-up event to DUG#1 and will
provide a space for developers to engage in more informal conversations
and discussions that may not have been covered during DUG#1. The vPub is
designed to be a less structured, more relaxed environment where developers
can discuss topics that are of interest to them. This can include off-topic
discussions, technical challenges they are facing, and ideas for new features
or improvements.

It all started with a small meeting after the virtual FOSDEM in 2021.
The ongoing pandemic had forced conferences to be held online and pub talks
were a thing of the past. But a group of open-source enthusiasts saw an
opportunity to come together and create something new. They organized
a small event to fill the void left by the lack of in-person gatherings.
Fast forward to 2023, and that small event has grown into a thriving community.
3mdeb has hosted five events that have brought together experts and enthusiasts
from all over the world. Each event has been a chance for the community to
come together, share knowledge, and learn about the latest developments in the
field of open-source firmware.

The vPub is open to all who are interested in Dasharo and want to learn more
about the platform. If you're curious about what was discussed in
previous vPubs, you can find a list of past topics on the Dasharo vPub
[page](https://vpub.dasharo.com). This will give you an idea
of the types of conversations that take place during the vPub and help you
decide if it's something you would like to participate in.

Overall, the Dasharo Developers vPub is an excellent opportunity to learn more
about Dasharo and connect with others. Whether you're an experienced developer
or just an open-source enthusiast, the vPub is open to everyone and provides
a valuable forum for learning and collaboration.
