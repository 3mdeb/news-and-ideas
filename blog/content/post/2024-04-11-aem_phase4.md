title: TrenchBoot Anti Evil Maid - Phase 4
abstract: "This blog post marks completion of next phase of TrenchBoot Anti Evil
           Maid project for Qubes OS. This time the project focused on AMD
           platforms, which is something that wasn't possible with original
           solution based on tboot."

## Introduction

If you haven't read the previous TrenchBoot AEM blog posts
([[1](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-01-31-trenchboot-aem-for-qubesos/)],
[[2](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-09-27-aem_phase2/)],
[[3](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2024/2024-01-12-aem_phase3/)]) or our [project
plan](https://docs.dasharo.com/projects/trenchboot-aem-v2/) yet, it may be a
good reading to catch up on what the TrenchBoot AEM project is about.

## What's new in TrenchBoot AEM?

The most significant change is obviously the ability to use AEM on AMD
platforms. Contrary to TXT, which uses SINIT ACMs signed by Intel, on AMD the
first piece of code executed after Dynamic Launch Event is fully controlled by
the user. Other than two 16-bit fields at the very beginning, format of DCE
(DRTM Configuration Environment) is decided by the implementation. Most notably,
this includes hand-offs (both GRUB2->DCE and DCE->Xen) and set and order of
measurements performed by DCE. In case of AEM, this could allow us to skip early
measurement done in Xen, but to keep code as similar as possible with TXT we
decided to not do this.

The DCE implementation used by this project is called Secure Kernel Loader (or
SKL), and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/secure-kernel-loader).

Unfortunately, TCG, Intel and AMD all use different names for the same component
or event. Hopefully, the following table can help with navigating between those
names and abbreviations.

| TCG                                              | Intel                                 | AMD                  | What is it in AEM world                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| DL_Event (Dynamic Launch Event)                  | SINIT                                 | SKINIT               | CPU instruction specific to vendor, executed by GRUB2      |
| DCE (DRTM Configuration Environment)             | SINIT ACM (Authenticated Code Module) | SL (Secure Loader)   | ACM for Intel, SKL for AMD                                 |
| DCE Preamble                                     | n/a                                   | n/a                  | GRUB2 - software that prepares and initializes DL_Event    |
| DLME (Dynamically Launched Measured Environment) | MLE (Measured Launch Environment)     | SK (Security Kernel) | Xen, DLME definition also covers dom0 kernel and initramfs |

Apart from addition of SKL and supporting it both in GRUB2 as well as in Xen,
few other, usually smaller changes were made:

- Script for dumping DRTM TPM event log was enhanced to support event log header
  as defined by TCG for TPM1.2 before the one specific to TXT. SKL puts TXT
  header as part of vendor info in TCG header, this gives a good compromise
  between two very similar formats - entries are identical, but headers are not.
- Scriptlet that creates grub.cfg file now searches for SKL, in addition to
  SINIT ACMs.
- GRUB2 is now able to choose best `slaunch_module` from all passed ones. This
  should allow users to put all ACMs and SKL in `/boot` directory, without
  having to choose the proper one.
- This release is published in a form of repository to (hopefully) make
  installation process easier.

## Installation

To install, you have to first add a new repository and import a public part of
a key that was used to sign RPM packages. To add a new repository, create in
dom0 as root `/etc/yum.repos.d/aem.repo` with the following content:

```text
[aem]
name = Anti Evil Maid based on TrenchBoot
baseurl = https://dl.3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/QubesOS/trenchboot_aem_v0.4
gpgcheck = 1
gpgkey = https://dl.3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/QubesOS/trenchboot_aem_v0.4/RPM-GPG-KEY-aem
enabled = 1
```

![Content of aem.repo](/img/qubes_aem_repo.png)

To download and import a signing key:

```bash
qvm-run --pass-io sys-net 'curl -L https://dl.3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/QubesOS/trenchboot_aem_v0.4/RPM-GPG-KEY-aem' > RPM-GPG-KEY-aem
sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-aem
```

![Importing signing key](/img/qubes_aem_import_key.png)

Now it should be possible to download and install packages from our repository.
As some of the packages are also available in standard QubesOS repositories,
potentially in never versions, those must be temporarily disabled during
invocation of `qubes-dom0-update`, as shown in the following commands.

> If any of the packages that are part of AEM are updated in standard repos,
> you will have to choose between using new versions or having working AEM, at
> least until new AEM release is published or the code gets merged upstream.
> If you decide to keep AEM after an update broke it, you will have to repeat
> the installation of overwritten package with `--action=reinstall` added to
> `qubes-dom0-update`, if it wasn't present before.

Start by installing prerequisite packages. Those are not part of newly added
repository, but `qubes-dom0-current-testing`:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-current-testing \
    oathtool \
    openssl \
    qrencode \
    tpm-extra \
    trousers-changer \
    tpm-tools
```

Next set of new packages comes from AEM repository, to avoid conflicts other
repositories are disabled for this call:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem \
    grub2-tools-extra \
    secure-kernel-loader
```

This is followed by reinstalling additional packages. A reinstall is required
because currently installed version is equal (or it may be higher in the future)
than those provided by AEM.

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem --action=reinstall \
    python3-xen \
    xen \
    xen-hypervisor \
    xen-libs \
    xen-licenses \
    xen-runtime \
    grub2-common \
    grub2-pc \
    grub2-pc-modules \
    grub2-tools \
    grub2-tools-minimal
```

> Depending on your starting point, it is possible that some of the above
> packages were updated in previous step. Reinstalling them isn't necessary, but
> it also doesn't hurt, other than taking a bit more time. It can only happen
> soon after release, because AEM packages are based on `testing` QubesOS
> repositories. After given package version gets out of `testing` into the main
> repo, reinstall is required. To keep instructions simple, you may assume that
> it is always required.
>
> Another possible error is `Installed package (...) not available`. The reason
> for it is the same as above, but solution is different: instead of
> reinstalling, you have to update mentioned packages by changing
> `--action=reinstall` to `--action=update` in the call. If there are multiple
> packages mentioned, all of them must be updated in the same invocation of
> `qubes-dom0-update`.
>
> Both of those problems will disappear in time - firstly when current `testing`
> lands in main repo, and then permanently after AEM based on TrenchBoot is
> fully merged to QubesOS. Until that happens, bear with us.

When booting on legacy (non-UEFI) system, GRUB2 must be manually installed to
the MBR.

```bash
sudo grub2-install /dev/sda
```

Finally, `anti-evil-maid` package may be installed:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=aem anti-evil-maid
```

Now you should provision AEM by following [instructions from previous
phase](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-09-27-aem_phase2/#aem-provisioning).

## Testing

To help with testing, `anti-evil-maid-dump-evt-log` was given new functionality.
Now, in addition to printing entries from event log, it also calculates and
prints expected values of PCR 17 and 18. This can be easily compared with actual
values, which can be read from `/sys/class/tpm/tpm0/pcr-sha{1,256}/1[78]`:

![Output of anti-evil-maid-dump-evt-log](/img/qubes_aem_dump-evt-log_amd.png)

> Keep in mind that just because replayed values match current PCR values
> **does not** mean that they are correct. It tells that whatever was measured
> to PCRs was also written to the event log, no more, no less. It may be used
> for debugging or catching the error early, but no security-related decision
> should be based on contents of event log.
>
> Digests stored in PCRs are all that matters. Sealing and unsealing operations
> are based on those values. From security perspective, the event log has any
> value only if PCRs hold proper digests.

## Next steps

While this phase marks the end of [the plan we published](https://docs.dasharo.com/projects/trenchboot-aem-v2/),
we will not stop there. We will continue with upstreaming the changes, first to
QubesOS repositories with patches, then to source repositories of components
taking part in AEM.

We also have plans for next phase, which will focus on enabling AEM for UEFI. It
will also focus on (re)testing the solution on all used platforms, to check if
everything still works as it should after recent changes.

## How you can help

By testing, of course! Install AEM, see if it performs as it should and report
any encountered problem in [trenchboot-issues
repository](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues).

Spreading the word is another way of helping. The more people know about AEM the
better. We may not be able to test it on every possible configuration, but
perhaps others have platforms that we don't.

You can also stay updated on our project's progress by visiting our [GitHub
milestones](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/milestones), and
join our discussions in the [public Matrix
channel](https://matrix.to/#/#OSFW-Trenchboot:matrix.org), where everyone can
participate and share their thoughts.
