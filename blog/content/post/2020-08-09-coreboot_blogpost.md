#### [coreboot Fundamentals Training](https://training.3mdeb.com/courses/coreboot-fundamentals)

It's hard to find a reliable source from which developers could draw and quickly
acquire knowledge substantial for fluent cooperation with coreboot. Relying on
official documentation and extensive practice is obviously the best way to
become proficient – we went this way ourselves – unfortunately, it is
time-consuming, especially when the new employee is joining the team and he
needs to be quickly introduced with the coreboot-based project. Based on years
of experience, vast knowledge, and a passion towards open source solutions,
we've responded to this need by providing reliable and professional training
that covers essential basics. We are proud of the way we've managed to hammer
out years of experience into modular, easy-to-follow 4-hours training. **In this
new blogpost series we will be publishing coreboot fundamentals mini-course**
equipped with coreboot essentials.
[coreboot Fundamentals Training](https://training.3mdeb.com/courses/coreboot-fundamentals)
is the first step of 3mdeb Firmware Training path. It provides solid grounds for
further development towards proficiency in coreboot firmware platform
enginering.

#### corebootability

Most modern platforms require closed-source BIOS for booting purposes. However,
BIOS is not featured by flexibility and easiness in supporting custom hardware
or maintenance. coreboot performs absolutely minimal hardware initialization
before kernel boot, what makes it much faster than BIOS. It supports online
updates, allows for SSH connections to load the kernel and by being open source
provides full insight of it's intestines and by that enhancing security. All
these features make users trust coreboot more than BIOS provided by hardware
vendors.

#### Why worthy

The training will give you an insight into coreboot firmware platform, defining
basics of platform boot process. You will learn how to build it's image and gain
practical knowledge about customization, project structure and a source code.
What about practice? We will show you how to reprogram SPI flash with only built
coreboot binary file. coreboot miniseries will start on our blogpost right next
week, but if you are interested in the full-time course, take advantage of our
pre-sale and get 30% discount for coreboot training fundamentals.

#### Why with Us

If you are reading our blogposts on regular basis, you have presumably known
most of our team or at least it's vast embedded knowledge. Our developers are
not only knitting high quality firmware, they are also likely to share their
experience by developing Embedded Firmware Training Program. We've been through
a long way developing and working on coreboot. It is a high time, to pass on our
experience in this field to support and shorten a long path of gaining
proficiency with coreboot. Even more eagerly, having in mind that there is no
reliable coreboot training available at all.

#### Training Overview

- coreboot basics

- coreboot boot process

- coreboot building

- running coreboot in QEMU

#### I am an embedded engineer. What is your superpower?

A path of Embedded Firmware Engineering is not an easy one to follow. It not
only forces the constant need of self-development but demands being up-to-date
with rapid changes around both; hardware and firmware area. However, gained
knowledge gets more and more value over time what provides stable work position
with above-average salary and greater recognition inside the industry. Embedded
engineer is a kind of a hybrid that brings together electrical engineering and
logic skills of a software programming. His path brings lots of opportunities
both in commercial and open ecosystem and even greater satisfacion thanks to the
role of mediator between hardware and software worlds. Embedded engineers can be
proudly called the alchemists of computing industry.
