## Summary

In these times various of SoC producents offers some important security
features. We can imagine more trustworhly devices but Xavier and others from
releated NVIDIA series are a good compromise between safety and gigantic
performance. Adding to that disabling JTAG port (this is available on Xavier
too!) you can create pretty save device - definetly more safe than most of 
endpoint devices that you can find at any time in your life. Secure Boot is
available in different devices too (and we have a experience in that!) - e.g
i.MX series and Rockchip. If it was curious, you may be interested in our
previous article about Secure Boot on

devices.

Secure Boot is only one of many safety features that we can implement in your
solution. We have full head of ideas how to make our lives safier - and we do it
every day. If you think we can help in improving the security of your firmware or you
