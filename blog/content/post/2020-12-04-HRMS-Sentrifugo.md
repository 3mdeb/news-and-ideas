### Introduction

The development of 3mdeb recently enabled the employment of a number of new developers and expanded our capabilities in the field of project management.
With the development of the organization, the amount of things that can be effectively managed has increased significantly. 

The use of balanced tools for human resource management can raise the level of team involvement and increase synergy. One of the tools for maintaining team cohesion is HRMS (Human Resource Management System), it allows you to support employees both inside teams and facilitates the management of cooperation between task groups.

### HRMS solutions

There are many HRMS software on the market. When choosing a solution, one should take into account the level of development of the company, its pace of growth and the field in which it operates. 

The first choice may be paid software, configured and prepared for the client by an external company. The advantage of such a solution is the lack of the need to learn advanced implementation options, an easy introduction to management, and relatively quick effects of use. While the downside is the lack of full control in the case of willingness to introduce changes and the costs of the same services with software, often in the form of a subscription, which for a small and medium-sized company may be an unnecessary cost. <br> <br>

There are also open source type software available on the market. For developers, it is a natural choice, a longer implementation process is compensated by the benefits of self-implementation and management of HRMS software, the possibility of any interference in the management structure. And defining parameters relevant to the organization allows you to adjust the management model to the current needs, not to mention much lower maintenance costs in the long term. 

### Odoo

Until recently, the management software in our company was [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) , it is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) tool that was successfully used to manage work inside the company. Along with the development and transition to new technologies, the use of Odoo ceased to be effective enough, the tool itself it has paid modules that were necessary for the efficient management of the organization. But none of the modules was used to a satisfactory degree, which generated unnecessary costs. 

### Sentrifugo

Currently, we are implementing the [Sentrifugo](http://www.sentrifugo.com/) solution. It is an open source tool, perfectly suited for small and medium-sized companies and gives the administrator total control over all available resources. For companies with a distributed structure, an undoubted advantage is the ability to configure Sentrifugo in the cloud.

Vacation group management, define vacation management options and define employee configurations.
The ability to assign roles and specific permissions to different groups of employees in the organization.
