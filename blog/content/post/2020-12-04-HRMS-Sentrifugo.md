### Introduction

The development of 3mdeb is very dynamic recently, expanding our capabilities in the field of project management.

The use of balanced tools for human resource management can raise the level of 
team involvement and create a happier and better-organized workforc. One of the tools for maintaining team 
cohesion is HRMS (Human Resource Management System), it allows you to support 
employees both inside teams and facilitates the management of cooperation 
between task groups.

### HRMS solutions

![hr-management](/img/hr-management.jpg)

There are many HRMS software on the market. When choosing a solution, one should 
take into account the level of development of the company, its pace of growth 
and the field in which it operates. 

The first choice may be paid software, configured and prepared for the client by an external company. The advantage of such a solution is the lack of the need to learn advanced implementation options, an easy introduction to management, and relatively immediate effects. The downside is the lack of full control and the costs of the same services with software, often in the form of a subscription, which for a small and medium-sized company may be an unnecessary cost. <br> <br>

There is also open source type software available on the market. For developers, it is a natural choice. A longer implementation process is compensated by the benefits of self-implementation and management of HRMS software. Defining parameters relevant to the organization allow you to adjust the management model to the current needs, not to mention much lower maintenance costs in the long term

### Odoo

Until recently, the management software in our company was 
[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) , it is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) 
tool that was successfully used to manage work inside the company. 
Along with the development and transition to new technologies, the use of Odoo 
ceased to be effective enough, the tool itself it has paid modules that were 
necessary for the efficient management of the organization. But none of the 
modules was used to a satisfactory degree, which generated unnecessary costs. 

### Sentrifugo

Currently, we are implementing the [Sentrifugo](http://www.sentrifugo.com/) 
solution. It is an open source tool, perfectly suited for small and medium-sized 
companies that gives the administrator total control over all available resources.

##### Here are a few of the many features we've found useful: 

* **Human resources** 
Vacation group management, define vacation management options and define 
employee configurations.
The ability to assign roles and specific permissions to different groups of 
employees in the organization.

* **Analysis** 
Access to a several of analyzes regarding key activities in the system and 
defining long and short-term goals
User activity, churn rate, employees by department and other relevant reports 
are built into the system.

* **Time management** 
Defining free time options for a department or the entire business unit. Specify 
weekends, business hours, transfer orders and much more.

* **Verification of the past** 
Verification of candidates using screening methods.
This gives the opportunity to improve the quality of candidates and employees by 
collecting the history so far and determining the accuracy of the information 
provided.

* **Recruitment management** 
Monitor and maintain the requisition process, from initiating applications to 
managing candidate resumes, scheduling interviews, shortlisting, and selecting 
applicants.<br>
Ability to track the interview round with feedback for each round and qualified 
candidates for the final round; reviewing each interviewer's comments for each 
round before scheduling the interview.

* **Interview plan** 
Planning an interview based on the availability of the interviewer.
Receive information about the interview schedule and
planning an interview to the next level for the selected candidate.

* **Feed Forward** 
Providing employees with an opportunity to evaluate the overall performance of 
their managers and evaluate them.

We are very curious about Sentifrugo's features and possibilities in practice. In the upcoming Sentifrugo dedicated blog post series, we will share our thoughts and tips for working with it right when we finish the implementation and get more experienced with the tool.
