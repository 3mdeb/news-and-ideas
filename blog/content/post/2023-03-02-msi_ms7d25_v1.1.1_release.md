## Introduction

Firstly, kudos to everybody who contributed to this release (in random order):
[zirblazer](https://github.com/zirblazer),
[marmarek](https://github.com/marmarek),
[collector-ynh](https://github.com/collector-ynh),
[renehoj](https://github.com/renehoj),
[micmarluc](https://github.com/micmarluc), the whole Dasharo community and the
Dasharo Team.

New year and new exciting news. Dasharo Team has just released a new version of
Dasharo firmware compatible with MSI PRO Z690-A. Last v1.1.0 version was
released on 22th of November 2022, and after three months, the time has come for
v1.1.1. Let's see what's new.

### Why v1.1.1 and not v1.2.0?

Last time we bumped the minor version from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0, it was dictated by
the coreboot base revision change, which could make a significant impact on the
platform operation. Despite a huge changelog of the v1.1.0 version, the coreboot
revision change was the main reason why the minor version of the release was
updated. This time we did not change the coreboot base revision and introduced
fixes and features to the existing base. Thus only the patch version has been
updated from v1.1.0 to v1.1.1. We expect the next minor version change to v1.2.0
when the coreboot base revision is updated to contain Raptor Lake-S support in
the near future.

## Key changes in the new release

The past three months were mostly spent on debugging and resolving issues
reported by the community on Matrix and
[GitHub](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/new/choose). By the
way, if you haven't joined our
[Matrix Dasharo space](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org) yet, do it
quickly! There are over 100 people in the `General` channel, and still growing.
This is where all interesting stuff happens, like various technical discussions,
hardware setups, firmware configurations, and encountered issues.

Let's have a look at the changelog.

### Added

#### [Early boot DMA protection menu option](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/275)

Many people reported various issues when DMA protection was introduced in
v1.1.0. Apparently, certain GPU cards contain broken OptionROMs which cause DMA
errors and display initialization problems. Thus the firmware setup will now
contain an option to enable/disable the DMA protection on-demand (with the
default state being disabled to avoid problems with dGPUs). Additionally, an
option to keep IOMMU enabled during OS control hand-off (actually during the
UEFI Exit Boot Services) has been added. This setting may be especially
interesting for people seeking the most secure configuration of the firmware.
But keep in mind that Windows will not boot if you enable this option! Refer to
our
[firmware setup documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#dasharo-security-options)
for more details.

#### ACPI PCI interrupt routing for CPU PCIe Root Ports

The CPU PCI Express root ports had no interrupt routing information reported in
ACPI. Just a small fix.

#### OC Watchdog ACPI device as in MSI firmware

Original MSI firmware has been reporting an ACPI device describing the
overclocking watchdog. This watchdog has been used by overclocking platforms
since the 6th generation of Intel Core processors. The same ACPI device has been
added to Dasharo to keep consistency. Possibly Windows overclocking tools may
depend on it.

### Changed

#### [Updated SMMSTORE driver to upstream version in UEFI Payload](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/303)

An update to the driver serving as a backend to write variables to the SPI flash
from UEFI Payload. The change was introduced due to problems with variable
updates on other Dasharo platforms. The advantage of the update is a cleaned-up
code with better quality. It also resulted in better reliability of `efibootmgr`
calls under QubesOS.

#### [Improved visual comfort in the boot manager](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/286)

One of the laptop users who could not distinguish the entries in the Boot
Manager boot device selection window reported a minor visual improvement
suggestion. Now the currently selected device is indicated by an arrow and
highlighted with blue color.

### Fixed

#### [MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI DDR4 doesn't initialize IGP on certain Processors models](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/274)

This fix is a crucial one in this release. Many users reported non-working
on-board displays with different CPUs than those which were tested in 3mdeb lab.
All Alder Lake-S graphics devices should be initialized properly now and give
firmware output on the screen. If you are unable to boot the DTS to provide
[HCL report](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#hcl-report),
then try using [fwdump-docker](https://github.com/3mdeb/fwdump-docker) image or
`cbmem` from the
[following guides](https://docs.dasharo.com/common-coreboot-docs/dumping_logs/).

#### [MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI DDR4 with two Video Cards (2x Radeon 5600XT) has issues related to MMIO resource allocation](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/245)

A quite specific issue with board configuration overloaded with GPU cards in the
community. As such configuration is uncommon, the debugging involved the issue
reporter cooperation by flashing custom binaries and providing debug logs from
Dasharo firmware. It happened that the memory requested by both of the cards was
too big to fit into the 32-bit space. The fix for this one required reserving
much more room for devices' memory in the 32-bit space by shifting some of the
usable RAM from 32-bit space to 64-bit space. Such change let the firmware
allocate all memory resources required by both GPUs.

#### [Suspend doesn't work in Qubes OS with v1.1.0](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/271)

Another issue discovered by the community. One of Dasharo Team members' changes
introduced a regression in the suspend/resume feature. All OSes were affected.
Fix has been applied, and the suspend/resume should now work on all OSes. The
tests have also been extended with multiple suspend/resume cycles to avoid such
problems in the future.

#### [Intel XTU on Windows reports "The platform does not support overclocking" on the MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI DDR4 with a K-series Processor](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/159)

The issue was reported by community in the first days after v1.0.0 release.
Surprisingly the Intel XTU utility reported that the platform does not support
overclocking, despite the fact that all components had all the overclocking
capabilities. The culprit was the OC lock bit being set by default in FSP, which
prevented Intel XTU from modifying any settings from the Windows level, so it
reported the platform as unsupported. The OC lock changes the initialization
path inside FSP, so you may encounter unexpected CPU configuration changes
compared to the previous release. Please do not hesitate to report them using
[GitHub issues system](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/new/choose)
or providing
[Dasharo HCL report via DTS](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#features).
One of such unexpected changes was an override of CPU turbo limits and causing
the CPU frequency to be lower than the maximum default value (and so the
performance was degraded).

#### [SATA ports malfunction or Hot-Plug function disabled](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/315)

A feature request from the community to enable SATA hot-plug functionality.

#### Platform sometimes automatically powers on after power off

Noticed by one of the Dasharo Team developers when dGPUs are plugged in. It
happened that the dGPUs were sending ACPI SCI interrupts which are not currently
handled by ACPI code, and it resulted in the instant wake up of the board when
powering off. The SCI interrupts have been disabled on all PCI Express Root
Ports until proper handling of SCI is implemented to fix the problem.

#### GPIO controller ACPI device yellow bang in Windows device manager

Despite previous attempts to fix the yellow bang of the GPIO controller in
Windows Device Manager, the issue persisted. The ACPI GPIO controller device had
all the definitions of GPIOs for Alder Lake-S, but apparently, Windows was
unable to properly initialize the GPIO because of the silent dependency on the
ACPI path of the device in the Windows GPIO driver. While Linux had no problems
with the previous ACPI path, but Windows could not properly load drivers in the
correct sequence. Thus the ACPI path had to be changed from `\_SB.PCI0.GPIO` to
`\_SB.GPIO` so that Windows will not depend on enumeration and initialization of
`\_SB.PCI0` ACPI device. Similar issues were observed with the TPM2 device ACPI
path. If set wrong, the Windows 11 installer would not work. Now the yellow bang
in Device Manager should be gone for good.

#### Resource conflicts: Chipset's P2SB PCI device incorrectly defined in coreboot

Issue observed during the 2x dGPU memory allocation problems and GPIO allocation
problems. It occurred that coreboot did not reserve proper memory range for one
of the chipset's internal PCI devices resulting in resource conflicts and issues
with the overall operation of conflicting devices. The issue could have been
detected earlier if not the FSP which hides this internal device during the
silicon initialization phase. The hidden device could not be detected by
coreboot resource allocator, and thus the reserved memory for this device was
not accounted for.

#### Reset button hanging the platform for up to 2 minutes due to watchdog bug

Noticed by the Dasharo Team developer and also reported by the Qubes OS
community. Not exactly a regression, but a bug in the OC watchdog hardware which
did not allow setting a small timeout to expire the watchdog after an unexpected
reset (a reset button press, for example). Initially, the OC watchdog was
designed to detect unstable overclocking configurations. When such a board
unexpectedly reset, the BIOS was supposed to detect it and act per policy to
restore safe configuration. Dasharo intended to use it in the same way, but the
timeout not updating bug in the watchdog hardware caused the firmware to wait
whole 2 minutes for watchdog expiration after the reset button press. Now
Dasharo firmware does not detect unexpected resets and simply initializes the
watchdog by programming the timeout. Tge watchdog expiration is not handled in
any way.

## Current state of Qubes OS R4.1.2 on MSI PRO Z690-A with Dasharo firmware

Here is a short demo of Qubes OS R4.1.2-rc1 running on the newest Dasharo v1.1.1
compatible with MSI PRO Z690-A. This Qubes OS instance has the `kernel-latest`
package installed to make suspend/resume working properly, because the Linux
kernel installed by default does not have the latest Intel graphics driver. In
the dmesg you can notice:

```bashtxt
i915 0000:00:02.0: Your graphics device 4680 is not properly supported by the driver in this
kernel version. To force driver probe anyway, use i915.force_probe=4680
```

It means that when your are going out of suspend you display may stop working.
To get it fixed, simply issue

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update kernel-latest
```

Then reboot the device and boot with the latest kernel. You should then see a
kernel version of 6.x in the output of the `uname -sr` command, e.g.:

```bashtxt
Linux 6.1.12-1.qubes.fc32.x86_64
```

## How to get the firmware update?

Please refer to the
[Firmware Update documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/msi_z690/firmware-update/)
and follow the instructions. Usage of automatic update via DTS is RECOMMENDED.

## GPU compatibility in open-source firmware

Issues described above (and also a few issues resolved before, e.g.
[this one](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/181)) showed us that
GPU compatibility in open-source firmware is a serious problem.

So one of the Dasharo Team members, [miczyg](https://github.com/miczyg1),
equipped himself with two additional GPUs to test more hardware and detect other
possible issues lurking out there. But these GPUs were selected with care and
balance in mind. And there is no better balance in the world and in the universe
than RGB! So the choice was:

- MSI Radeon RX 6500 XT MECH 2X OC 4GB GDDR6
- MSI GeForce RTX 3060 GAMING Z TRIO LHR 12GB GDDR6
- and the integrated Intel graphics for perfect balance :)

RGB as in red/green/blue, the three basic colors, ingredients that can create
any other possible color; RGB as the pixel layout in graphics framebuffers; RGB
altogether creates a white light, a sunlight; and sunlight means life...

Ok enough poetry... To prove that these are not empty words, here's a photo of
the mentioned setup:

### WARNING: LOTS OF RAINBOWZZZZZ

![img](/img/rainbowzzz.jpg)

The Nvidia RTX 3060 is sooo big that it covered the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, which
is connected underneath. Sometimes bigger means beefier:

### But size doesn't matter, right? ... Right?! :)
