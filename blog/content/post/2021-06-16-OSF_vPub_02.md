On our 2nd OSF vPub, amoung the many major topics we have explored the software
freedom of RISC-V implementations and new devices such as BeagleV. RISC-V is
attractive to the people who aren't satisfied with the software freedom problems
of the more popular architectures such as x86. And it's essential to ensure that
this emerging platform is going in the right way and figure out how can we help.

Among our many close friends from all over the world who found the time to join
us, it was a great honour to be visited by Richard Stallman - who shared lots of
worthy ideas (such as having a roadmap & status pages) to assist the liberation
of RISC-V. Many people (myself included!) were happy to discuss with RMS, - and
we at 3mdeb will try to invite more such prominent guests to our future events.

Also, there was a lot of exciting talk about [LibreSOC][1], [Chips4Makers][2], [OpenBook][3],
[PowerPC Notebook][4], [Precursor][5], [Open Security Training][6], [OpenXT][7], [OpenBMC][8], [Pinephone][9]
and many other wonderful projects that can be surely of your interest (please
check the links!). Overall, our gathering was a great opportunity not just to
spend a nice time in a cosy atmosphere, but also to learn more about the
open/libre software, firmware and hardware, - and the security benefits these
projects are bringing to the people.

If you are interested in those topics, feel free to reach us out by writing to
<contact@3mdeb.com> and [sign up to our newsletter][10]. If you would like a live chat,
write to @mikebdp2 on Wire messenger - and I will add you to our OSF vPub group.
