There are not so many resources about being Embedded Systems Consultant. Most
popular resources like famous [Jack Ganssle
post](http://www.ganssle.com/consulting.htm) and recommended [Steve
Friedl](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html) post just scratch the
surface of consultant life. My personal experience is not so rich, but I would
like to provide resource for prospecting Embedded Systems Consultant and
customers looking for better understanding of project analysis.

I will focus on small to medium size projects (typically not longer then 9
months), since this is area of my main expertise. This kind of projects are
usually prototypes that when proved move to productiziation phase, which in
itself consist on different requirements.

Below description covers process that should be adjusted to customer needs and
is not considered corportation-grade.

## Project analysis

One of the first step after being reached by potential new client (PNC) is
initial project analysis, which can be divided into:

* project feasibility studies
* project estimation

Not all projects requires feasibility analysis, but some do. Both phases takes
time that consultant have to spent before starting any job, because of that it
is reasonable to think that initial analysis is a product and should be
provided in that form.

## What should be deliverable of project analysis ?

In general customer should receive document based on which business decision
can be made.

* Brief project description
* Feasibility and risk analysis
* Plan of action
* Time estimates
* Additional cost

Usually those sections overlap in some way.

### Brief project description

Section should in general describe consultant's understanding of project and
goals that have to be achieved. It is good to provide requirements or features
as list of bullet points in this point to build correct ground for whole
document.

This section should present minimal information that describe project.

### Feasibility and risk analysis

This section is core of whole document. It contain information about features
and how those can be implemented.
