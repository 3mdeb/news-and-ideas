title: Boot Guard - pre-execution firmware verification on Protectli FW6
abstract: 'This post will not describe how to guard your shoes. However,
          will definitely introduce you to Boot Guard feature present on
          Intel processors which allows firmware verification before the first
          instruction executes. One may call it pre-execution firmware
          verification. The post will also show you how Boot Guard can work
          well with coreboot based firmware on an example of Protectli FW6.'

### What is Boot Guard?

Boot Guard does not mean exactly what its name suggest, it is not
protecting shoes. In firmware and BIOS nomenclature `boot` means the bootstrap
process, which is the early processor initialization routine. Almost every
modern machine or processor has some kind of firmware which is responsible for
the bootstrap process - booting - which prepares the silicon to load the target
application or operating system. So ‘Boot Guard’ quite literally protects the
boot process and the firmware. But from what should it protect and why? You can
find it out by spending a few minutes to read this post.

### Why Boot Guard?

Nowadays security researchers are very focused on the trustworthiness,
security, and hardware-level safety of the computers we use everyday. These
so-called “white hat” researchers explore every possible vulnerability and
attack vector in modern systems to find holes in the security of the most
crucial parts of our modern systems, such as Intel ME, UEFI, and others.
Conversely, the bad guys, commonly known as “black hats” are constantly trying
to find new and innovative ways of gaining access to systems that are harder to
detect. Traditionally, the bad guys would find bugs in browsers or network
protocols that would give them root access to the operating system and allow
them to then install tools to keep their access persistent. Researchers and
anti-virus companies would usually detect these exploits by scanning memory or
files for known virus signatures, then patch holes and cleanse infected
systems. However, this game of security cat and mouse has now evolved to the
point where the bad guys are looking for new and interesting ways of not only
gaining access to systems, but also maintaining that access undetected.
Logically, the place for malicious software to hide and stay undetected is in
the part of the system that the operating system and no knowledge of or access
to - the system firmware.

How do you know that software you use is trustful, secure and hasn't been
maliciously modified before execution? One can only ensure this by establishing
the Root of Trust (ROT) as early as possible. 

There are 2 main type of ROTs:
- SRTM - Static Root of Trust for Measurement
- DRTM - Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement

We will not delve too deep into the measurement process of ROT, as it is not a
part of this post, but what we will focus on here is cryptographic verification
in the ROT. ROT is the beginning of the verification process, it is considered
to be trusted and verifies all components executed by firmware. For DRTM it may
be any time after the system has been powered on, because the processor is
responsible for establishing a clean environment for ROT to begin the
verification process. For SRTM it is the very early moment in the boot process.
As soon as firmware sets up temporary memory, it launches an executable module
responsible for establishing ROT and further firmware image verification. While
this all sounds great, how can one protect this early code responsible for
temporary memory setup and ROT establishment?

> For more details about ROT refer to [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Hardware-Roots-of-Trust).
>
> Some details about DRTM can be found on [TrenchBoot GitHub](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/documentation).
> We are also involved in DRTM development on AMD platforms and contribute
> actively to TrenchBoot. One may find our achievements on various conferences:
>
> - [PSEC2019 - Less-Insecure Network Edge Virtualization with Low Size, Weight and Power](https://www.platformsecuritysummit.com/2019/)
>
> - [OSFC2019 - TrenchBoot - Open DRTM implementation for AMD platforms](https://osfc.io/talks/trenchboot-open-drtm-implementation-for-amd-platforms)

Protecting the ROT can be achieved by locking the SPI flash containing the
firmware for example, however this does not protect the SPI from a desoldering
attack. Attackers can actually physically solder a new SPI which can contain
maliciously modified firmware which compromises the Root of Trust and even
install backdoors, keyloggers, RAT’s or other malware.

In order to protect systems from even desoldering attacks, we can use Boot
Guard, which verifies the early firmware code responsible for temporary memory
setup and ROT establishment before the firmware is able to execute. Because of
that Boot Guard is an SRTM solution.

### How Boot Guard works?

Intel Boot Guard is a feature that allows firmware verification before the
first instructions get executed. How was this achieved? This feature is
supported by Intel ME, which instructs the processor to load an Authenticated
Code Module (ACM) signed by Intel responsible for manifests validation and boot
policy enforcement. During the verification process, ME utilizes the Key
Manifest, Boot Policy Manifest (which is a part of Boot Guard) and the Firmware
Interface Table (FIT). Before fetching the first firmware instructions, the
processor searches for the FIT and applies microcode updates which are pointed
by FIT. The microcode verifies the ACM, which verifies the Key Manifest, which
verifies Boot Policy Manifest (so complicated right?). In the end the Boot
Policy Manifest contains the hashes and signatures of the code regions in
firmware that have to be protected and verified. After the firmware
verification, ACM allows the processor to fetch the first instructions to be
executed.

So in the event that the firmware is maliciously modified, it would not be able
to execute. It would fail because the manifest that holds the firmware signing
keys would fail the firmware verification. As an added step, the public key
hash of the key used to sign the Key Manifest can be burned into the ME and
locked permanently to ensure that no one except the key owner can change the
firmware signed in the Boot Policy Manifest.

The flow described here is one of the most restrictive profiles that Boot
Guard offers - strict verification without remediation. There are less
restrictive profiles which allow the platform to keep running for 30 minutes if
firmware verification fails in order to restore the system and flash trusted
firmware. But the production behavior of Boot Guard ensures that unverified
firmware cannot execute on the processor and immediately shuts the platform
down.

### Where can I get Boot Guard for my platform?

One has to either pay thousands of dollars to a big firmware development
company to enable Boot Guard on your hardware or buy costly hardware which has
Boot Guard already enabled.

That was true until now. Recently, one of our customers -[Protectli](https://protectli.com/?utm_source=3mdeb&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=bootguard) -
asked us to improve the security of their network focused product called the
Vault by implementing Boot Guard. Protectli sells compact network devices
running Intel processors and the most powerful of them have Intel processors
which are Boot Guard capable. As a matter of fact, 3mdeb had previously
implemented coreboot for these platforms, so implementing Boot Guard was
a natural enhancement to the overall security of the system.

And today we have succeeded. The first official platform running open-source
firmware that has Boot Guard enabled is here. It is possible thanks to the fact
that Protectli cares about hardware security and sees value in open-source
firmware and software.

This first-of-its-kind platform can be seen in action at the 3mdeb booth at
Embedded World 2020, but here is a brief glimpse of what you can expect to see
at the Embedded World 2020 exhibition.

### Boot Guard and coreboot? Yes, of course.

The below asciinema video presents the Protectli FW6B platform booted with Boot
Guard enabled coreboot firmware executing an Intel tool called `MEInfo`, which
is used to dump information about system and Management Engine.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/InShgUHnP389ERobESFG6BYxf.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/InShgUHnP389ERobESFG6BYxf?speed=1)

In the video, we see some interesting detail, including Boot Guard info:

- `OEM Public Key Hash FPF                      Not set`
- `OEM Public Key Hash ME                       7E8E9BF4EF2E3AC831672D0049414081EA8D32C2E36B5D69457D4E3AA0B70517`
- `ACM SVN FPF                                  0x2`
- `KM SVN FPF                                   0x0`

The `OEM Public Key Hash` represents the SHA256 of the key used to verify the
Key Manifest. It is located in the ME and on production devices is is burned
into FPF (Field Programmable Fuses).

`ACM SVN FPF` describes the ACM security version, `0x2` means it is a
production ACM.

`KM SVN FPF` is a Key Manifest security version. It is used to revoke Key
Manifests. `0x0` means that no Key Manifest was revoked yet.

There are also some additional variables stored in ME:
```
                                             FPF                      ME
                                             ---                      --
Force Boot Guard ACM                         Not set                  Disabled
Protect BIOS Environment                     Not set                  Enabled
CPU Debugging                                Not set                  Enabled
BSP Initialization                           Not set                  Enabled
Measured Boot                                Not set                  Disabled
Verified Boot                                Not set                  Enabled
Key Manifest ID                              Not set                  0xF
Enforcement Policy                           Not set                  0x1
PTT                                          Not set                  Enabled
```

`Force Boot Guard ACM`, `Measured Boot`, `Verified Boot` and `Enforcement
Policy` make up the Boot Guard profile.

They can be encoded as follows:

Firmware verification with Boot Guard is enabled, `Enforcement Policy` equal to
1 means "allow remediation", system will shutdown after 30 minutes if firmware
verification fails. Disabled `Force Boot Guard ACM` means that if ACM is not
found in firmware, the processor will execute the code from a reset vector. If
enabled, the system will shut down with a delay based on the
`Enforcement Policy`. It must be noted that not all combinations of these
fields are allowed. Only strictly defined Boot Guard profiles determine these
fields' values.

Other interesting values are `CPU Debugging` and `BSP Initialization` which
additionally protect the boot flow from modification via DCI or INIT signal.

Thus far, we have only seen the status of variables. However the status of
successful Boot Guard firmware verification lies in the status registers:

- `FW Status Register4: 0x00084000`, bit 14 is equal to one indicates that the
  information contained in this register is valid. Bit 9, which is zero,
  indicates that the enforcement has not been triggered

- `FW Status Register5: 0x00000B01`, bit 31 is equal to zero, which means the
  chipset does not start enforcement logic. Bit 0 is equal to one and indicates
  that ACM is active (and of course present in firmware).

That means the system will not shutdown after 30 minutes as the Boot Guard
profile instructs the processor (if verification fails). 

Summing it up:
**Boot Guard verified the firmware successfully.**

## Summary

This is just a taste of what Boot Guard can do. The presented information and
demonstration show non-production settings and the ME is still in Manufacturing
Mode which allows the settings to be reprogrammed. It has been intentionally
left enabled for further development.

I encourage you to visit the 3mdeb booth at Embedded World 2020 (25th - 27th of
February 2020 in Nuremberg, Germany). There, you will be able to see the Boot
Guard demo live. We will be at **hall 4 - 666**.
