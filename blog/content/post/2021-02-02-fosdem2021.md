### Introduction

This is another year in which, together with
[Daniel Kiper](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/daniel_kiper/) from
Oracle, we have the pleasure to organize Open Source Firmware, BMC and
Bootloader devroom during FOSDEM 2021 as a continuation of this devroom of the
previous edition. We take part in this event to promote the use of free and open
source software, and show how it can increase security and the quality of the
code itself and give more business freedom outside of the vendors lock-in, from
the point of the firmware level which is our bread and butter in 3mdeb. In this
blogpost we will gather all the information about the event and links to the
videos from the FOSDEM 2020.

> FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and
> collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source
> software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. In 2021,
> they will gather online.

### Why Open source

Before diving into the technical information around FOSDEM, let's make a step
back and refresh the ground knowledge that made us choose the Open Source path
as users, contributors, developers, supporters – OSS community members.

- Open source builds trust in the features and quality of the software. If the
  company wants to start developing OS project, it needs to check its quality.
  The published code's quality can be easily scanned by having full insight into
  the source code.

- Developers are building a visible portfolio by contributing to the Open Source
  project. The company that decided to develop a particular project is more
  eager to hire contributors with proven expertise.

- The company can get improved performance for a relatively short amount of
  time. Having open-source repository allows to prove the competencies and gain
  trust without any additional audit or checks.

- The source code has no value itself. Most of the products are made by
  modifying existing code components, so technology knowledge that allows
  performing on the ready-to-use code in the proposed business model brings the
  essential value. There are some exceptions to that like very innovative and
  research base solutions or fully-featured systems, which secrecy may build
  value that owners do not want to give to the community using OSS license.

It is significant that companies are increasingly switching to using and
publishing open source software due to the reasons mentioned above. So having it
in mind, let's have a look into event details below.

### Where to link the event?

- To participate, no registration is needed. Check the
  [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/open_source_firmware_bmc_and_bootloader/)
  and choose the talks you would take part in. We are in
  [D.firmware](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/room/dfirmware/) room.
- Find the live streaming for a D.firmware
  [here](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/streaming/). The page will be updated
  every few minutes to show you what is currently scheduled in each room.

### How we are proceeding this year

This online event will take place on 6 & 7 February 2021. Here you will find
[the full schedule](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/open_source_firmware_bmc_and_bootloader/).
The below points will be updated with recordings after the event.
