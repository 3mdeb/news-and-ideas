### Day 2

## Intro
TBD

* [Marvell Octeon TX2 CN913x fully open source firmware](https://vimeo.com/488149573) by Marcin Wojtas

Marcin explained how to port edk2 for Armada8k allowed adapting on new platforms
and presented firmware development goals for high-end ARM-based hardware
(SBSA/SBBR, SystemReady ES). Kudos to [Semihalf](https://www.semihalf.com/).

* [An open-source SPDM implementation for secure device communication](https://vimeo.com/488130792) by Jiewen Yao, Xiaoyu Ruan

Interesting talk about Security Protocol and Data Model standard (1.0 and 1.1).
Explicitly presented communication between Requester and Responder, Transport
Layer Binding, and features. Kudos to [Intel](http://intel.com/).

* [POWER9 support in coreboot](https://vimeo.com/488133382) by [Michał Żygowski](https://twitter.com/_miczyg_) and [Piotr Król](https://twitter.com/pietrushnic)

Talk held by our team. We have briefly described use cases, the project's
development roadmap, next steps within [Dasharo](dasharo.com) project, seamless
integration of Intel FSP or AMD AGESA with UEFI-compliant and legacy OS
interface. [Contributions](https://opensource.3mdeb.com/projects/coreboot.html).

* [Trusted Execution Environment on OpenBMC](https://vimeo.com/488146312) by [Vernon Mauery](https://twitter.com/vmauery), Zhikui Ren

BMC firmware for Intel. Interested improvements for ipmi password, ARM security
(TEE) for protecting the password, and initial secret and safe/trusted execution
environment. Kudos to [Intel](http://intel.com/).

* [AMD's Journey towards Open Source OpenBMC firmware](https://vimeo.com/488132697) by Supreeth Venkatesh

The talk went through the main features implemented in meta-amd for OpenBMC.
Very detailed and exciting journey. Kudos to [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) for
your work.

* [Introducing open firmware development model for the Programmable Service Engine's in Intel Atom x6000E Series](https://vimeo.com/488148045) by Loo Tung Lun

Session described Internal CPU based on ARM Cortex M7 core, introduced in
Elkhart Lake. Mentioned iotg-fbu to support PSE development. Kudos to
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/) for this great talk.

* [Open Source firmware testing with ConTest](https://vimeo.com/488148599) by [Christian Walter](https://twitter.com/nablahero), [Andrea Barberio](@insomniacslk)

Project co-organized by Facebook + 9elelments. The contest is presented as a
major framework for OCP. Big Kudos for sharing!

* [pure open source on an AMD Zen](https://vimeo.com/488147337) by [Ronald g. Minnich]https://twitter.com/coreboot)
Very Rust talk dedicated to the project X aimed at eXcising binary blobs from
the x86 part of Zen CPUs. Thank you, Ron, for an outstanding share.

* [Linuxboot on HPE platform where do we stand](https://vimeo.com/488143135) by [Jean-Marie Verdun](@vejmarie)

Important status of the project. Challenges, proof of concept, next steps. HPE
seems to provide LinuxBoot-enabled Facebook servers – "private customer." Kudos
to [HPE](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) for the status.

* [TrenchBoot DRTM features for AMD platforms](https://vimeo.com/488140434) by [Michał Żygowski](https://twitter.com/_miczyg_) and [Piotr Król](https://twitter.com/pietrushnic)

The second talk of our team describing the progress of the
[TrenchBoot](https://opensource.3mdeb.com/projects/trenchboot.html) project.
Overall status, added features, support for the AMD Secure Startup.

### Day 3

* [oreboot status report](https://vimeo.com/488139577) by Ryan O'Leary, [Ronald g. Minnich](https://twitter.com/coreboot)
We've got a few interesting facts:
* oreboot works on booting TockOS (Rust)
* it can be tried on QEMU
* works with OpenTITAN chips (FPGA)

[Zephyr as an open platform for Google's embedded controllers](https://vimeo.com/488150463) by Paul Fagerburg, Jack Rosenthal

Interesting facts about google plans in contributing to Zephyr OS, RTOS as an
alternative for a custom kernel. Kudos to google for the great news.

* [Arm SystemReady and the UEFI firmware ecosystem](https://vimeo.com/488131661) by Samer El-Haj-Mahmoud, Dong Wei

Just a few keynotes:
arm ServerReady certificate applied to embedded systems
* SBSA/SBBR/ACS
* for embedded BSA/BBR/ACS
* SBBR/EBBR/LBBR
* BBSR/EBBR BaseBoot Security and Embedded BBR
* there is no ISV ecosystem that Arm endorse for certification
Kudos to [Arm](http://arm.com/)
