# Introduction

If you haven't read the previous [TrenchBoot AEM blog
post](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-01-31-trenchboot-aem-for-qubesos/) or
our [project plan](https://docs.dasharo.com/projects/trenchboot-aem-v2/) yet,
it may be a good lecture to catch up on what the TrenchBoot AEM project is
about. This post will guide you through the most recent progress and show a
demo of TrenchBoot AEM in action, plus installation steps.

## What's new in TrenchBoot AEM?

The main focus of this phase was to get the TPM 2.0 working with Qubes OS AEM
scripts on the DRTM boot flow in TrenchBoot (GRUB and Xen). Let's go through
each of the tasks quickly.

### Implement parallel CPU cores bring-up for DRTM launch

It is not strictly related to TPM 2.0 support, but after phase 1, it occurred
to be necessary to clean up the code for CPU bring-up in Xen. As the phase 1
was just a Proof of Concept, some inefficiencies in the code happened to land.
The most significant change in this [pull
request](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/1/files) is the parallel
bring-up of the CPUs, in opposite to the previous implementation, which caused
the CPUs to wait in a queue. It had to be fixed because PoC implementation
hardcoded some of CPU features as enabled, which could potentially break booting
without DRTM.

### Support for TPM 2.0 module in Xen

With the introduction of TPM 2.0 support, Xen also required changes that would
perform the Dom0 kernel and initrd measurements properly. As a quick reminder,
TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 communication protocols to extend the PCRs with software
measurements differ slightly. Also, TPM 2.0 uses stronger hash algorithms than
TPM 1.2, like SHA256, which had to be added to Xen. Changes are outlined in
this [pull request](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/3/files).

### Support for TPM 2.0 event log in Xen

Similarly to the previous task, besides the communication protocol difference,
the event log, where the information about measurements is stored, differs
between TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0. As a next step after measuring the Dom0 kernel
and initrd to TPM 2.0 PCRs, we had to record the hashes in the event log in
TPM 2.0 compliant format. The event log is a very important chunk of
information, which lets one confirm what is measured and if the TPM PCRs
actually match the values that have been extended.
Changes to Xen are outlined in this [pull
request](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/xen/pull/4/files).

### Integrate TPM 2.0 software stack into Qubes OS Dom0

This is where the changes outside of Qubes OS sources end. A first
prerequisite to making the AEM scripts talk to TPM2 was to include the
appropriate tool stack. Up till now, AEM implementation only had the TPM 1.2
software and utilities included. This [pull
request](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-antievilmaid/pull/46/files) outlines
TPM 2.0 software, which has been included in Qubes OS initrd and will be used
by AEM scripts later.

### Extend the AEM scripts to detect TPM version on the platform

Before TPM 2.0 could be used, we had to prepare routines that detect the TPM
version and temporarily refuse to use AEM if TPM 2.0 is detected. It was just
a stepping stone to avoid issuing unsupported commands to TPM 2.0 using TPM
1.2 software until proper TPM 2.0 support is added. Changes are outlined in
this [pull
request](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-antievilmaid/pull/45/files)

### Extend the AEM scripts to use appropriate software stack for TPM 2.0

Now that we have the TPM version detection in place, we could start
implementing the equivalent AEM functionality for TPM 2.0. The scripts have
been generalized and split into separate "libraries" for TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0
with a unified, higher-level API, abstracting the TPM version in the main AEM
logic. First, we have isolated the TPM 1.2 support and prepared the
higher-level API as a grounding for the incoming TPM 2.0 support in this [pull
request](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-antievilmaid/pull/47/files). Then,
we proceeded with adding the actual TPM 2.0 support in this [pull
request](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-antievilmaid/pull/42/files). Besides
the changes in the main AEM repository, there were various other extra
repositories, which were responsible for features like Qubes OS disk migration
to another machine (i.e., to detect multiple different TPMs on different
devices when AEM is used). Those also needed TPM 2.0 equivalents to maintain
the functionality. The changes are outlined in the following pull requests:

* [qubes-tpm-extra](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-tpm-extra/pull/7/files)
* [qubes-trousers-changer](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-trousers-changer/pull/6/files)

### Test TPM 2.0 support on Intel hardware with legacy boot mode and Update Qubes OS AEM documentation

Of course, the changes had to be validated using Intel-based platforms capable
of doing DRTM with TPM 2.0. As a reminder, older Intel platforms like 3rd
generation Ivy Bridge could only support TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT (Intel's DRTM
technology), so for testing purposes, we had to use newer hardware. It also
goes without saying that the test should be conducted on the machine with TPM
1.2 to check if the new changes didn't break anything.

As a cherry on top, the Qubes OS AEM documentation was extended and improved
to reflect the current state of AEM support, now covering TPM 2.0.
Unfortunately, it still supports legacy boot mode only. But support for UEFI
boot mode will also be added in the future. The changes are outlined in this
[pull request](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/qubes-antievilmaid/pull/6).

## Installation procedure

To summarize our efforts, a short demo/instruction has been prepared
showcasing the newest Qubes OS AEM installation and utilization on a
relatively modern Intel platform with TPM 2.0 - a HP EliteDesk 800 G2 DM.

You can download the AEM packages from [3mdeb's
FTP](https://dl.3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/QubesOS/trenchboot_aem_v0.2/)
and verify their integrity using [this

```

Our starting point is the fresh installation of [Qubes OS
R4.2.0-rc3](https://ftp.qubes-os.org/iso/Qubes-R4.2.0-rc3-x86_64.iso) with the
AEM v0.2 packages and Intel SINIT ACMs placed in Dom0 home directory.
To download SINIT ACMs from Intel portal, simply invoke:

```bash
wget -O 630744_003.zip https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/630744
```

Assuming that the RPMs and ZIP is in your Dom0 home directory already, open
the Dom0 terminal. Unzip the ACMs package and copy the right ACM to the boot
partition. In our case it is:

```bash
sudo cp 630744_003/SKL_KBL_AML_SINIT_20211019_PRODUCTION_REL_NT_O1_1.10.0.bin /boot
```

Next, install required dependencies for AEM (we do it manually because we
install local RPM packages later):

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-current-testing \
    oathtool \
    openssl \
    qrencode \
    tpm-extra \
    trousers-changer \
    tpm-tools
```

![Installing dependencies 1](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_1.png)
![Installing dependencies 2](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_2.png)

Then install the following packages:

```bash
sudo dnf install \
    ./python3-xen-4.17.2-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
    ./xen-4.17.2-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
    ./xen-hypervisor-4.17.2-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
    ./xen-libs-4.17.2-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
    ./xen-licenses-4.17.2-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
    ./xen-runtime-4.17.2-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
    ./grub2-tools-extra-2.06-2.fc37.x86_64.rpm
```

![Installing Xen/Python/GRUB packages 1](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_3.png)
![Installing Xen/Python/GRUB packages 2](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_4.png)

> There might be an error in the xen-libs installation, but it does not affect
> AEM operation. The cause is yet unknown.

Then reinstall the following packages (these need reinstall command because
the version in the RPMs did not change compared to the version provided in
Qubes OS R4.2.0-rc3):

```bash
sudo dnf reinstall \
	./grub2-common-2.06-2.fc37.noarch.rpm \
	./grub2-pc-2.06-2.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
	./grub2-pc-modules-2.06-2.fc37.noarch.rpm \
	./grub2-tools-2.06-2.fc37.x86_64.rpm \
	./grub2-tools-minimal-2.06-2.fc37.x86_64.rpm
```

![Reinstalling GRUB packages 1](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_5.png)
![Reinstalling GRUB packages 2](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_6.png)

Before installing AEM package, we also need to perform GRUB installation to
the disk where Qubes OS is stored, in our case it is `/dev/sda` (yours may be
different so watch out!). This will ensure the support for DRTM is installed
in GRUB:

```bash
sudo grub2-install /dev/sda
```

At last we can install the AEM package itself:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./anti-evil-maid-4.1.1-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm
```
> When installing AEM package it may seem that it hung at `Running scriptlet`
> step. Please be patient and let the system finish installation.

![Installing GRUB to disk and AEM package](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_7.png)
![Installing GRUB to disk and AEM package](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_8.png)

All packages are in place. Before we can proceed with provisioning AEM, we
have to clear the TPM in the BIOS. Otherwise the next step may return the
following error:

![AEM TPM setup error](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_9.png)

Some platforms may require disabling Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)
in order to clear TPM. So after you clear the TPM, remember to enable Intel
TXT back, otherwise AEM will not work. Once TPM is cleared, perform the TPM
setup:

```bash
sudo anti-evil-maid-tpm-setup
```

![AEM TPM setup 1](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_10.png)

You will be prompted to set the SRK password, it is a password to access TPM's
nonvolatile storage where the AEM secrets will be sealed.

I have also shown the TPM properties to prove that we are using TPM 2.0. You
can omit this. Then let's perform the AEM installation. In our example we are
installing the AEM with MFA to the internal disk where Qubes OS is installed.
This is generally not recommended, because using MFA and internal disk does
not provide any extra security over not using MFA. But it is just for
demonstration purposes. So in your case feel free to install AEM even on an
external storage. In our case the boot partition is `/dev/sda1` (your may be
different depending on where would you like to install AEM).

```bash
sudo anti-evil-maid-install -m /dev/sda1
```

![AEM installation 1](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_11.png)
![AEM installation 2](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_12.png)

If you chose MFA, then you will be presented a QR code to scan with an
authentication app of your choice. it will show you a TOTP code later at boot
process. This step will also ask you to provide a password for the secret and
second time to provide any of the disk passwords for confirmation.

The system now is ready to perform AEM boot, so reboot your machine!
Now you should be presented with a SRK password prompt like this:

![AEM SRK password prompt](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_13.png)

And later with the standard disk password prompt:

![AEM disk password prompt](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_14.png)

After that AEM will print the messages saying, that the secrets have been
sealed to the LUKS PCR 13 DRTM PCRs 17 and 18:

![AEM secrets sealing](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_15.png)

You should see the above screen only once (unless you change something with
GRUB, Xen or Dom0 kernel/initrd). Now that the AEM knows what the final PCR
values should be, after next reboot AEM will successfully unseal the secrets
it just sealed before a moment, and present a TOTP code. But before that, save
the current PCR values by invoking the following command in Dom0 terminal:

```bash
sudo tpm2_pcrread sha256
```

![TPM PCRs](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_16.png)

Note the PCR values somewhere and reboot the machine. If everything went
correctly, the PCRs should not change after reboot (you can comapre by reading
the PCRs again with `tpm2_pcrread` when booted) and you should be presented a
TOTP code during LUKS key file password prompt, like this:

![AEM TOTP code](/img/qubes_aem_v0.2_17.png)

Check the TOTP code in your authenticator app to ensure it is correct and then
type the password provided in the `anti-evil-maid-install` step. if there was
any error, it should be displayed in the top left corner of the screen and you
would be prompted for your regular disk password, because the LUKS key would
not be unsealed by AEM.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes the TOTP code does not immediately appear after second reboot,
because the AEM secret could not be unsealed. It may be caused by the TPM
safety timer. If your machine was cut off from power in the last 74 minutes
(2^22 ms), you may experience such issue. Simply try to reboot the machine at
a later time and TOTP should appear.

You can check the AEM services status using the following command in Dom0:

```bash
journalctl -u anti-evil-maid-unseal -u anti-evil-maid-seal
```

## Summary

It has been quite a long journey implementing the TPM 2.0 support, yet much
more awaits us. We bet you are eager to hear more about TrenchBoot AEM and
can't wait to see the AMD DRTM or UEFI boot mode support coming to Qubes OS.
It will be the first time AEM is launched on an AMD platform, which certainly
stirs up some hype. If you like what we do, please consider supporting us:
