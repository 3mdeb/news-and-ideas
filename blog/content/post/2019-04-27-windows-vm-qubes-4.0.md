We are fascinated about Qubes OS approach to security and system design for a
long time. Personally I use Qubes OS daily for almost 2 years. Definitely this
is not the system for everyone, but this is not the topic of following blog
post. From time to time I have need to run some software or do some checks on
Windows environment. Typically I used [freely available VMs from Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms) on
some Virtualbox. In this blog post I would like to run Windows 7 VM from
provided image in Qubes OS 4.0.
