This is another blog post discussing Qubes OS. This time we would like to
address interesting target which is Android x86. There may be many needs why
you need that system varying from leveraging interesting Android features (e.g.
Google specific services, games and applications).

# Getting ISO

Android x86 images can be downlaoded from [this website](). In following
tutorial I used [Android x86_64 8.1-r1](https://dotsrc.dl.osdn.net/osdn/android-x86/69704/android-x86_64-8.1-r1.iso).

# Creating qube
