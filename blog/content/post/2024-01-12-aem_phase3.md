title: TrenchBoot Anti Evil Maid - Phase 3
abstract: "This blog post marks completion of next phase of TrenchBoot Anti Evil
           Maid project for Qubes OS. Even though user experience didn't change
           too much, the implementation went through a major overhaul."

## Introduction

If you haven't read the previous TrenchBoot AEM blog posts
([[1](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-01-31-trenchboot-aem-for-qubesos/)],
[[2](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-09-27-aem_phase2/)]) or our [project
plan](https://docs.dasharo.com/projects/trenchboot-aem-v2/) yet, it may be a
good reading to catch up on what the TrenchBoot AEM project is about.

## What's new in TrenchBoot AEM?

This phase doesn't really add any new features visible from user's point of
view. Instead, it focused mostly on bringing the code up to current Secure
Launch implementation, which was still evolving when we started the AEM project.
With Secure Launch code brought up to speed, we should be able to put more
effort towards upstreaming soon.

Taught by our hiccups with earlier phases, we also changed our approach to
testing. Now we don't check only if the PCRs were extended, but also whether
their values are correct. Qubes OS packages, created by CI, are now used
wherever possible, and manually built Xen and/or GRUB are used only for
development and debugging outside of Qubes OS.

### Secure Launch specification

Secure Launch specification was created as an attempt to provide a unified
experience in passing configuration and other meta-data to a TrenchBoot Secure
Launch entry point across all supported architectures. Latest version of the
specification can be found on [TrenchBoot
site](https://trenchboot.org/specifications/Secure_Launch/).

The document starts with an overview of architecture, which describes what
components take part in dynamic launch, together with interactions between them.
It is followed by description of Secure Launch Resource Table (SLRT), which
takes majority of specification.

One very important part of SLRT called DRTM Measurements Policy describes what
components have to be measured by DLME (Dynamic Launch Measured Environment, Xen
in our case). The size of this entry may vary to provide flexibility for
different number of components. This allowed us to properly measure more than
just two of modules passed to Xen (dom0 kernel and initramfs), so previous
limitation that excluded microcode and
[XSM](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Security_Modules_:_XSM-FLASK) has
been lifted.

Addition of Multiboot2 protocol to the Secure Launch entailed new entry type for
modules. This was not added to the specification yet, we're still gathering all
small fixes that can be done before next revision [in this
issue](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/documentation/issues/23).

## Installation

From user's point of view the installation process is virtually the same as
before. Follow [instructions from the previous blog
post](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2023/2023-09-27-aem_phase2/#installation-procedure)
and you're good to go. Just remember to use binaries for v0.3, which can be
downloaded from [here](https://dl.3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/QubesOS/trenchboot_aem_v0.3/).
The same components have to be installed as before, but keep in mind that their
revisions are different, so you can't just copy and paste the instructions as
they are in previous post. This shouldn't be a problem, you don't mindlessly run
commands suggested by some random guy on the Internet in dom0 anyway, right? :)

If you're updating from previous AEM version, keep in mind that unsealing will
fail on the first boot. This is expected, and it is [described in AEM
README](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/qubes-antievilmaid/blob/aem_v0.3/README#L319).

## Testing

One additional change visible for the user is the ability to dump TPM event log.
A script doing just that is part of `anti-evil-maid` package. It can be run as
root in dom0 by calling `sudo anti-evil-maid-dump-evt-log`. Example output
obtained on HP EliteDesk 800 G2 with Intel Core i5-6500T:

To verify PCR values are correct digests from the entries can be extended using
debug PCR 16 (make sure it is reset before starting!) and compared with actual
values of PCR 17 and 18.

## Known issues

We've noticed few issues that we share here for full transparency:

* Bad measurement logged by ACM. This isn't exactly something we can fix, as ACM
  is closed-source binary signed by Intel, and Intel won't fix such old and
  no longer officially supported CPU family. What we may try to do is to catch
  this problem in parser, inform the user about it and print proper value.
* Xen on HP mentioned above doesn't bring up all cores after TXT launch. This
  doesn't happen on any other platform we tested. "Clean" Xen without [patches
  applied for Qubes OS](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-vmm-xen) (but with AEM
  patches we developed) doesn't exhibit this problem, neither does it happen if
  Qubes OS is started without AEM - it seems that there is some interaction
  between those, we're still debugging it.
* There is no textual description of events logged in early environment, even
  though that data is available as part of DRTM Measurements Policy. Passing it
  to function that does the measurement and logging would require calculating
  string length and `strnlen()` is not available for linking in early code.
* Xen doesn't measure and log `SLAUNCH_START` and `SLAUNCH_END` entries. These
  are used to mark beginning and end of measurements to not allow any software
  running either before or after to create entries impersonating expected
  components.
* S3 still wasn't tested, and probably doesn't work, or worse: works insecurely.

## Next steps

As said in the introduction, code that uses SLRT is now close enough to the
final form that we can safely focus on upstreaming it. In fact, SMP bringup
already [has been sent to xen-devel mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/xen-devel/cover.1699982111.git.krystian.hebel@3mdeb.com/T/#mf8795d739334a3d4df0b9bd5588a86690da39c83).
It is common code used by every Xen boot (on x86) so it went separately, mostly
as a way to introduce ourselves before dropping relatively big new feature that
a handful of people would ever use. Next sets of patches will probably target
[QubesOS organization on GitHub](https://github.com/QubesOS) before true
upstream sources. That way we will be able to get review from final users of AEM
before bothering wider audience.

Next phase will bring support for AEM to AMD processors. This should make it
easier, cheaper, and generally more available - for TXT you need vPro processor,
but for AMD you just need any processor, starting with Athlon 64. Anything
younger than 15 years should do, as long as the platform has a discrete TPM.

## How you can help

By testing, of course! Install AEM, see if it performs as it should and report
any encountered problem in [trenchboot-issues
repository](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues).

Spreading the word is another way of helping. The more people know about AEM the
better. We may not be able to test it on every possible configuration, but
perhaps others have platforms that we don't.

You can also stay updated on our project's progress by visiting our [GitHub
milestones](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/trenchboot-issues/milestones), and
join our discussions in the [public Matrix
channel](https://matrix.to/#/#OSFW-Trenchboot:matrix.org), where everyone can
participate and share their thoughts.
