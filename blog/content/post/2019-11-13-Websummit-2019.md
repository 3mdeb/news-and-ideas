Founded in 2009, originally held in Dublin until 2016, when it moved permanently
to Lisbon, Web Summit is considered to be the largest tech event in the world.
Until 2019 there was no representation of 3mdeb on Web Summit, but now we've
decided, that it is the right time to send one.

"Tech event" is the keyword that turns all of us on and makes us travel over
thousand kilometers, but after the struggle I was the one who become the first
official 3mdeb representative on that event. Full of hope and curiosity, with
a great financial and organizational support provided by Export Broker, at
Sunday, November 3, I've joined polish group on the Lech Walesa airport in
Gdansk.

Have you heard about the main types of a lie?

In classical version there are small lies, big lies and statistics. I've found
another - calling Web Summit a tech event. Blows up the scale. It was political,
it was sociological, it was futuristic, but it has much more to present about
the people relations, than about technology.

The opening day was a series of presentations. The main guest wasn't physically
with us, but his speech was streamed from Russia. Edward Snowden - the great
warrior for freedom of speech, which had left western world and settled down
in the capital of freedom - Moscow. Though I don't consider him the most
reliable man living, the speech itself was fine. In the end he started to accuse
companies by their name for trying to enslave world population, and when he
got to Huawei it appeared that he runned out of time. The next speaker was
Guo Ping, Huawei's Rotating Chairman - astonishing coincidence, isn't it?
He tried to persuade an audience that all the thing anyone heard about his
company is a lie, no matter the facts. Hopefully there were a lot of young
and inexperienced people there, in the other case the audience might not be
persuaded.

After the opening there should be a Night Summit event. But it was raining, and
almost no one came.   

Day two started with a something-like-fairs, but many of the companies
exhibiting there had nothing but themselves for sale. At first I stayed
at Polish Agency for Enterprise Development stand. I want to sincerely thank
all the people there for helping me to present our products and let me to leave
our materials on the stand. After several hours of explaining children what
firmware and embedded are I've decided to stop wasting my time, and move forward
to hunt some commercial pray. I've visited surroundings stands looking for
someone who would understand what are we doing, why, and be interested in
cooperation. It was tough. Web Summit is large. I was told that there were
over 70.000 attenders and 12.000 CEO's. Founding someone who runs a REAL tech
company suitable for us was a lot of walking and talking. Finally I've succeeded
but in a bit unexpected way.
