As we wrote [here](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2019/2019-08-07-qubes-os-and-3mdeb-minisummit/), recent Qubes OS 'minisummit' 2019 turned out to be fruitful and productive
event. Great piece of knowledge has been presented and many ideas came up from
long and deep discussions. Positively built with this experience, as observing
changes inside security of firmare and computer architecture, we  couldn’t miss
the opportunity and decided to organize Qubes OS minisummit, edition 2020. We
want  to share our knowledge and our experience around topics presented below
hoping, that once more, we go far beyond the agenda. This year, we will stand
side by side with Frédéric Pierret and Marek Marczykowski Górecki from QubesOS
team, covering the following topics:

* 20.05
  1. Michał Żygowski Qubes OS on modern AMD platform
  2. Norbert Kamiński Status fwupd/LVFS support for Qubes OS
* 28.05
  1. Piotr Król SRTM for Qubes OS VMs
  2. Michał Żygowski Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform
* 04.06
  1. Piotr Król DRTM for Qubes OS VMs
  2. Michał Żygowski Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform
* 10.06
  1. Frédéric Pierret: How to build Qubes? From components to operating system
overview.
  2. Marek Marczykowski-Górecki Operating system testing, when it itself uses
 virtual machines.


Each stand will be divided into broad status report, design talk with proposals
and discussion ended with  **Q&A** time for our viewers, so they could actively
participate in the dialogue. We hope that the most promising presentations will
be transformed into community supported or publicly founded projects.

## Where to link the event?

We are going to stream transmission via OBS on our YouTube 3mdeb channel. All
you need to do is joining our [live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_djHbyjuJvhVjfT18nyqmQ/live) in an appropriate time: all data details you will find below. Minisummit starts
 right next Wednesday, so the opening presentation goes on the 20th of May at
 4:00PM (CEST+2:00).

### Whom will you meet?

Prelections will be held by the team of 3mdeb experts who will share their
knowledge and experience discussing AMD SEV and fwupd/LVFS, DRTMs and RTMs in
Qubes OS. Among them are Piotr Król, founder and Embedded Systems Consultant at
3mdeb as well as CTO of vitroTV, Michał Żygowski, 3mdeb core developer of
Coreboot, maintainer of Braswell SoC, PC Engines, Protectli and Libretrend
platforms and Norbert Kamiński, Junior Embedded Systems Engineer focused on
Linux embedded systems. Qubes OS testing and development will be widely
presented by Qubes core developers, Marek Marczykowski-Górecki Project lead in
QubesOS, specialized in everything Xen / Linux related and Frédéric Pierret,
General packaging, CentOS and Fedora templates maintainer.  

More about Qubes OS project you will find [here](https://www.qubes-os.org/).


### Why Qubes Os?

To gain security of an Open Source quality.

> There is not enough synergy between firmware and operating systems world,
especially in the light of heavy use of isolation mechanisms like
(nested-)virtualization or cgroups. Co-organizing this event with Qubes OS we
would like to build awareness about opportunities that open collaboration can
bring to community through correct leveraging of modern platform security
features. We hope this activity may convince silicon vendors and their
OEM/ODM, that putting more effort in contribution to open source projects has
not only ethical implications, but brings better economical results through
wider and faster adoption of new hardware. In recent years open-source and
security community proven many times its effectivness in after-market product
suppport and discovering inefficiencies and security issues in the hardware
design.

### Why you should join?

To gain practical, valuable first-hand knowledge and meet experts who are
happy to answer intriguing questions and share their passion without creating any
marketing pitch.

>I'm excited about upcoming Qubes OS minisummit, happening thanks to 3mdeb
folks. There will be many interesting topics presented by competent people. And
also a lot of potential for further collaboration!

## Summary

We are all waiting for Qubes Os minisummit 2020 where the 3mdeb experts will cover
topics related with status fwupd/LVFS support, SRTM and DTRM for Qubes OS and
Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform. Qubes OS specialists will
tell us how to build and test operating system that uses virtual
machines. Every discussion will end with Q&A session where participants will have the opportunity to join discussion. At this point, awaiting for the event, we want to thank both the experts who will devote their
time to sharing knowledge and experience, but also the participants of the
event, passionate about QubesOs, without which the event would not make sense.
 See you next Wednesday!
