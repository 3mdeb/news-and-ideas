Many times happened that I spend time, during the installation of the new
system, whether it be a virtual physical machine, wondering about it's hostname.
One day I asked myself the trouble searching for host name generator.

Best I could find (currently second in the results of google) is rospo.net. It
gives you the choice of category for the host name. My favorite, as a fan of
fantasy is "Characters from Tolkien". Although the category name does not
reflect the truth, because in addition also includes a set of known sites in
middlearth and more.Â So I recommend:
