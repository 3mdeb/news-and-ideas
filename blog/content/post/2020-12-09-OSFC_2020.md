This year we've again had double track insight into the [Open Source Firmware
Conference](https://osfc.io/) as both participants and presenters. We want to
share some thoughts that evolved during the talks and send kudos to many people
who made this conference happen, starting with [9elements Cyber
Security](https://9esec.io) for gathering crucial voices of contributors from
various firmware community corners. In this short, blogpost series, we will
leave a few notes on every attended presentation, starting from day 1, according
to the [schedule](https://cfp.osfc.io/osfc2020/schedule/) with references and
sources. You can go through the post or skip to the chosen conference. Remember,
presented descriptions are only our humble opinion, not official statements of
presenters. To watch the full video and get your own opinion, click the chosen
title.  

### Day 1

* [Why LVFS is Essential for OEMs](https://vimeo.com/488137809) by [Richard Hughes](https://twitter.com/hughsient)

The Linux Vendor Firmware Service, an essential part of the Linux ecosystem, is
worth digging in. It allows its users to keep hardware up to date with firmware
updates. Now we are waiting for fwupd for QubesOS. Kudos to [Red Hat](https://2019.osfc.io/uploads/talk/paper/9/Introducing_the_Linux_vendor_Firmware_service.pdf) for your work.

* [UEFI compliance testing](https://vimeo.com/488138727) by Heinrich Schuchardt

These guys are doing great stuff for ARM and RISC-V with tools that are worthy
of mentioning, e.g., Platform Initialization SCT and Firmware Test Suite (FWTS).
The overall quality of UEFI-compliance test results is impressive. We liked the
idea of UEFI Self Certification Tests, UEFI SCT compliance across various UEFI
implementations for different platforms (QEMU, x86, RISC-V). Kudos to [U-Boot](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot) for your work.

* [coreboot Thermal Management on Intel based systems](https://vimeo.com/488143663) by Sumeet Pawnikar, Timothy Wawrzynczak

Intel works on this contribution to enable efficient thermal management for
Google Chromebooks. It is an important topic for all types of devices,
especially those focused on energy saving, e.g., mobile platforms. The
presenters discussed the added ACPI code and explained the code tree with its
structure. Kudos to [Intel](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/coreboot.html) for your piece of work.

* [Bootling Linux more safely with safeboot](https://vimeo.com/488144473) by [Trammell Hudson](@qrs)

Trammel, the founder, and contributor of safeboot, presented a convenient talk
around configuring UEFI Secure Boot tools. Kudos to Trammel Hudson for his work [safeboot](https://safeboot.dev/)

* [PRM: SMM Goes on a Diet](https://vimeo.com/488136678) by Michael Kubacki

Great, technical presentation on System Management Mode.  A few noticeable facts:
* some hardware resources can only be accessed in SMM
* RAS relies on SMM and SMI handlers
* UEFI Capsule Update and Authenticated Variables
* SMM is related to OCP and server use cases https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu3DRLM1dPA
Kudos to Microsoft and Intel for your [joint effort](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Microsoft-PRM-OSFC-2020).

* [Building an alternative ecosystem to UEFI](https://vimeo.com/488136082) by John Looney

John presented Facebook build system, stages of industrialization (Prototype ->
EVT -> DVT -> PVT -> Mass production), and testing (1000 reboots test are
Facebook standard for DRAM init). According to Facebook: it's 2x faster to
enable the platform on coreboot than UEFI. Good to hear that! Kudos to
[Facebook](https://github.com/facebook) for insight into your work.

* [System Transparency and it's bootloader implementation stboot](https://vimeo.com/488128723) by [Jens Drenhaus](https://twitter.com/jens_drenhaus)

The presentation was about stboot LinuxBoot distribution. Jens described swtpm
testing and D-RTM (Intel version) use case for system provisioning with tboot.
Kudos to [9elements](https://9elements.com/) for your project.

* [kexec based bootloaders/fast rebooting: Boon or Bane](https://vimeo.com/488150148) by
[Bhupesh Sharma](https://twitter.com/bhupesh_sharma)

The main theme was kexec-related problems, e.g., in the cloud environment and
with DMA devices. Kudos to [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) once again.

* [Unit testing coreboot](https://vimeo.com/488135518) by Jan Dąbroś
Interesting presentation on the coreboot unit testing infrastructure with the
use of cmocka framework. Congratulations to
[Semihalf](https://www.semihalf.com/) for entering the coreboot land

* [Guiding Engineering Teams Toward a More Secure Usage of U-Boot](https://vimeo.com/488134063) by [Jon Szymaniak](https://twitter.com/sz_jynik)

NCC Group presented its definition of Secure Boot (BSP), U-Boot usage, and its
supply chain. Thank you [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/) for delivering
high-quality content in the area of embedded systems and embedded firmware
security.

Thanks for getting here! We hope that you have found our summary helpful in
exploring tech news within the firmware world. In the next blogpost we will
present some thoughts on OSFC 2020 day 2.
