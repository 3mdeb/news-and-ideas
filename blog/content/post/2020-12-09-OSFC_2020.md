This year we've had double track insight into the [Open Source Firmware
Conference](https://osfc.io/) as both participants and presenters. At the
beginning big kudos to 9elements for organizing the event and gather crucial
voices of contributors from various firmware community corners. We want to share
some thoughts that evolved during the talks and send kudos to many people who
made this conference happen. We will leave a few notes on every attended talk,
from day 1 to day 3, according to the
[schedule](https://cfp.osfc.io/osfc2020/schedule/), trying to gather talks with
references and sources. You can go through the post or skip to the chosen
conference. Remember, presented descriptions are only our interpretation, not
official statements of presenters. To watch the full video and get your own
opinion, click the chosen title.  

### Day 1

* [Why LVFS is Essential for OEMs](https://vimeo.com/488137809) by [Richard Hughes](https://twitter.com/hughsient)

The Linux Vendor Firmware Service, an essential part of the Linux ecosystem, is
worth digging in. It allows its users to keep hardware up to date with firmware
updates. Now we are waiting for fwupd for QubesOS. Kudos to [Red Hat](https://2019.osfc.io/uploads/talk/paper/9/Introducing_the_Linux_vendor_Firmware_service.pdf) for your work.

* [UEFI compliance testing](https://vimeo.com/488138727) by Heinrich Schuchardt

These guys are doing great stuff for ARM and RISC-V with tools that are worthy
of mentioning, e.g., Platform Initialization SCT and Firmware Test Suite (FWTS).
The overall quality of UEFI-compliance test results is impressive. We liked the
idea of UEFI Self Certification Tests, UEFI SCT compliance across various UEFI
implementations for different platforms (QEMU, x86, RISC-V). Kudos to [U-Boot](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot) for your work.

* [coreboot Thermal Management on Intel based systems](https://vimeo.com/488143663) by Sumeet Pawnikar, Timothy Wawrzynczak

Intel works on this contribution to enable efficient thermal management for
Google Chromebooks. It is an important topic for all types of devices,
especially those focused on energy saving, e.g., mobile platforms. The
presenters discussed the added ACPI code and explained the code tree with its
structure. Kudos to [Intel](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/coreboot.html) for your piece of work.

* [Bootling Linux more safely with safeboot](https://vimeo.com/488144473) by [Trammell Hudson](@qrs)

Trammel, the founder, and contributor of safeboot, presented a convenient talk
around configuring UEFI Secure Boot tools. Kudos to Trammel Hudson for his work [safeboot](https://safeboot.dev/)

* [PRM: SMM Goes on a Diet](https://vimeo.com/488136678) by Michael Kubacki

Great, technical talk on System Management Mode.  A few noticeable facts:
* some hardware resources can only be accessed in SMM
* RAS relies on SMM and SMI handlers
* UEFI Capsule Update and Authenticated Variables
* SMM is related to OCP and server use cases https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu3DRLM1dPA
Kudos to Microsoft and Intel for your [joint effort](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Microsoft-PRM-OSFC-2020).

* [Building an alternative ecosystem to UEFI](https://vimeo.com/488136082) by John Looney

John presented Facebook build system, stages of industrialization (Prototype ->
EVT -> DVT -> PVT -> Mass production), and testing (1000 reboots test are
Facebook standard for DRAM init). According to Facebook: it's 2x faster to
enable the platform on coreboot than UEFI. Good to hear that! Kudos to
[Facebook](https://github.com/facebook) for insight into your work.

* [System Transparency and it's bootloader implementation stboot](https://vimeo.com/488128723) by [Jens Drenhaus](https://twitter.com/jens_drenhaus)

The talk was about stboot LinuxBoot distribution. Jens described swtpm testing
and D-RTM (Intel version) use case for system provisioning with tboot as an
alternative for TrenchBoot. Big kudos to [9elements](https://9elements.com/) for
your project.

* [kexec based bootloaders/fast rebooting: Boon or Bane](https://vimeo.com/488150148) by
[Bhupesh Sharma](https://twitter.com/bhupesh_sharma)

The main theme was kexec-related problems, e.g., in the cloud environment and
with DMA devices. Kudos to [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) once again.

* [Unit testing coreboot](https://vimeo.com/488135518) by Jan Dąbroś
Interesting talk on the coreboot unit testing infrastructure with the use of
cmocka framework.  Kudos to [Semihalf](https://www.semihalf.com/) for sharing
your thoughts.

* [Guiding Engineering Teams Toward a More Secure Usage of U-Boot](https://vimeo.com/488134063) by [Jon Szymaniak](@sz_jynik)
NCC Group presented its definition of Secure Boot (BSP), U-Boot usage, and its
supply chain. Thank you [NCC](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/) for sharing.

### Day 2

* [Marvell Octeon TX2 CN913x fully open source firmware](https://vimeo.com/488149573) by Marcin Wojtas

Marcin explained how to port edk2 for Armada8k allowed adapting on new platforms
and presented firmware development goals for high-end ARM-based hardware
(SBSA/SBBR, SystemReady ES). Kudos to [Semihalf](https://www.semihalf.com/).

* [An open-source SPDM implementation for secure device communication](https://vimeo.com/488130792) by Jiewen Yao, Xiaoyu Ruan

Interesting talk about Security Protocol and Data Model standard (1.0 and 1.1).
