title: 'Dasharo Tools Suite: the story about scalability and stability'
abstract: 'Nowadays every software technology is subject to entropy that causes
a cutting-edge technology to become legacy code faster and faster. The
architecture initially developed for scalability becomes harder and harder to
maintain. The initially added functionalities become outdated and unstable. In
such rough times, it is important to develop a correct strategy for developing
and maintaining your software. This blog post covers Dasharo Tools Suite
automation and testing technologies designed to fight problems, costs, and
bureaucracy in its development process.'
