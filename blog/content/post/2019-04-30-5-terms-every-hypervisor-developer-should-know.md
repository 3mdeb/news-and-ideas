This is the first post of a series about developing type-1 hypervisors, also
known as *native* or *bare-metal* hypervisors. It introduces to Intel's VMX
technology, describes interactions between a virtual machine and a hypervisor
as well as gives some insight on the control structures required. This post
should give some theoretical knowledge base required for the next ones, in
which we will implement a basic hypervisor using [Bareflank](https://github.com/Bareflank/hypervisor).
It assumes that you have some knowledge about IA-32 architecture. There will be
more than 5 terms actually, but the most important are those in headers. The
following posts will assume that the reader knows what they are for and what is
their scope.

## Introduction to VMX

Virtual-machine extensions (VMX) define processor-level support for virtual
machines on IA-32 and IA-32e processors. There are two kinds of VMX operation:
VMX root operation and VMX non-root operation.

CPU in VMX root operation is almost identical to that of non-VMX operation,
except for some additional instructions (for setting up and starting virtual
machines) and some CR limitations (e.g. paging has to be enabled at all times,
meaning that switching between processor modes is limited).

In VMX non-root operation CPU behaviour is limited or altered. Some operations
and events are forbidden, others can be configured to interrupt normal program
flow and exit to a special handler running in root operation. This behaviour
cannot be altered from within non-root operation mode even in ring 0, that is
why VMX root mode is often called ring -1.

In later versions of VMX, there are new instructions available (VMCALL and
VMFUNC). This allows for easier implementation of hypercalls, where a
virtualization-aware OS or application wants to exchange information directly
with a hypervisor. Hypercalls can be used for managing a virtual environment or
to get some statistics from hypervisor - useful for debugging. Without these
instructions, it is still possible to implement similar functionality, as we
will see later in the series.

Hypervisors can be classified as one of two types:

* type-1 (bare-metal, native) hypervisors. A hypervisor is run directly on the
  hardware and is not managed by an operating system. Examples of this type are
  [Xen](https://xenproject.org/), [Hyper-V](http://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v)
  and [Oracle VM Server](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/vm-server-for-x86/).
  The first hypervisors, developed by IBM in the 1960s, were also of this type.
* type-2 (hosted) hypervisors. In this case, each virtual machine, as well as
  the hypervisor itself, are just other processes running on top of the
  operating system. Examples are [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html),
  [VMware Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html),
  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

Note that there is no clear distinction between those two, there are some
hypervisors that are somewhere in between. [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)
for example is a kernel module that converts a whole OS to a type-1 hypervisor,
but because Linux still is an operating system it has to control access to
resources between processes, as type-2 hypervisor does.

## VMM

Virtual machine monitor. It is a part of the software that handles all VM exits.
Works in VMX root operation, it has full access to the hardware and almost full
control of CPU. Why almost? It has some of the bits in control registers fixed
to ensure proper execution. Trying to change CPU mode is one of the examples of
such restrictions, so goodbye, real mode. Another thing that is limited in VMX
root operation is that INIT signal is blocked - because of that it is impossible
to reset other cores of CPU, which would effectively destroy everything that VMX
gave.

Other than those limitations, VMM can use everything that IA-32 has to offer.
This includes interrupt and exception handlers (very useful, especially when
passing instructions from VM to real hardware), virtual memory (might be used
for easier mapping of VM memory, but it isn't common) and even going to ring 3
(I don't think anyone would like to lower his/her privilege level here, but who
knows?).

It is VMM's task to isolate VMs from each other, if desired. VMM is the place
where code and data for handlers is located, because of that it is crucial that
VMM's memory is inaccessible from virtual machines. Such protection is possible
with the help of EPT (extended page-table), but this mechanism is worthy of
another post so I won't describe it further right now.

Intel's *Software Developerâ€™s Manual* calls this `host`, while most of the world
leave this name for something else - I'll mention it later in this post. As
with other multi-processor environments, we can develop symmetric and asymmetric
VMMs. In this series, I will assume that a VMM on one core is a separate entity
from another core, even on symmetrical systems. Hopefully, this will better show
all nuances and possibilities of virtualization.

A hypervisor is more than only its VMM part. It needs some initial setup, most
likely a glue layer for the underlying system and sometimes checks for its
starting arguments.

## VM

Virtual machine, also called guest software. It consists of OS and application
software. Software running on VM usually is not aware of the fact that VMM
controls hardware and that there may be other VMs running on the same platform,
but it can be. Most of the times any application that can run on real hardware
can also run inside a VM, depending on hypervisor implementation.

As with VMM, VMs can also be symmetrical or asymmetrical when it comes to
multi-processor execution. Again, I will restrict VM to one core. Here it makes
even more sense because VMM can implement a scheduler and run multiple VMs on
one physical core, in turn. For most people that were using only type-2
hypervisors one VM probably means one HDD, couple GBs of RAM and a multicore
CPU, as it meant to me not so long ago. So, let's call one virtual PC a *virtual
environment* and everything seen by one core (general purpose registers, MSRs,
APIC, memory etc.) is a *virtual machine*. This definition of VM is more or less
consistent with how they are managed under the hood. I'll try to stick to these
names, but bear with me if I make a mistake at some point :)

All VMs work in VMX non-root operation, they are called `guest` in SDM as well
as by everyone else, but...

#### Host-VM

There is one special VM that was created as first VM, it is a virtualized
version of the operating system or firmware that hypervisor was started with.
Note that it is sometimes called as a host (because it was there before
hypervisor) and sometimes as a guest (because it is a VM after all), depending
on context.

Handlers for this VM, with few exceptions, pass through all accesses to the
hardware in order to make continued operation of the OS/FW possible.

In theory, this VM isn't necessary, but it is convenient to leave it. Host-VM
provides many useful parts, such as memory management, ACPI tables, firmware for
peripheral devices etc. Hypervisor would have to do all that and much more by
itself if it wasn't for this VM.

## Transitions

There are only two types of transition: VM exit and VM entry. As you can see,
they are named relative to the VM, as this is where the CPU should spend most of
the time. VM exit is a transition from VM to VMM, or non-root to root operation
(these are synonymous); VM entry - the other way around.

Multiple checks are performed both on entries and exits. When an error occurred
during VM entry it is possible to just not get into VM or return as soon as
error on VM side happens. Error on VM exit is worse - they happen only when
there is no valid VMM to get back to, which leads to VMX abort, after which
the processor is put into a shutdown state.

Old state is saved and a new one is loaded from VMCS (virtual machine control
structure, described later) or structures that VMCS points to. There is a field
for MSRs table, so VMM can fill in the ones that it intends to change and they
will be saved/restored as a part of the transition.

#### VM entries

VM entries happen as a result of VMLAUNCH or VMRESUME. Steps are done in order:

1. Basic checks are performed to ensure that VM entry can commence (valid VMM
   state, valid VMCS).
2. The control and host-state areas of the VMCS are checked to ensure that they
   are proper for supporting VMX non-root operation and that the VMCS is
   correctly configured to support the next VM exit.
3. The guest-state area of the VMCS is checked to ensure that, after the VM
   entry completes, the state of the logical processor is legal.
4. MSRs are loaded from the VM-entry MSR-load area.
5. If VMLAUNCH is being executed, the launch state of the VMCS is set to
   "launched".
6. An event may be injected in the guest context.

#### VM exits

There are many possible reasons for the VM exit.

1. Information about the cause of the VM exit is recorded in the VM-exit
   information fields and VM-entry control fields are modified.
2. Processor state is saved in the guest-state area.
3. MSRs may be saved in the VM-exit MSR-store area.
4. Processor state is loaded based in part on the host-state area and some
   VM-exit controls. Address-range monitoring is cleared.
5. MSRs may be loaded from the VM-exit MSR-load area.

As you can see, there is no explicit error checking performed - it doesn't make
sense to return back to VM anyway in this case. An error can happen when for any
reason VMCS gets corrupted (memory range containing VMCS was not properly
protected from VMs, different core in VMM mode or another hardware through DMA
corrupted VMCS, physical memory error). It isn't possible to return to a non-VMX
state because it is not saved anywhere - host-VM is still only a VM, it is
indistinguishable from any other VM at this time. CPU is put into a shutdown
state and only RESET signal can bring it back. All this is done to prevent any
chance of privilege elevation - safety is considered more important than
continued operation in this case.

## VMCS

VM control structure. It is pointed to by VMCS pointer - one per logical
processor, which is the main reason why VMs are limited to one core from the
developer's point of view. There is always one VMCS per VM, even on symmetric
implementations, because some of its fields describe CPU state at the time of
the transition between VM and VMM so they cannot be shared by multiple cores.

The exact layout of this structure, as well as its size,  is implementation
specific. For this reason, as well as because it can be internally cached by
CPU for better performance, fields of VMCS should not be accessed directly.
Special instructions defined by VMX should be used instead (VMCLEAR, VMREAD and
VMWRITE).

The VMCS data is organized into six logical groups:

* **Guest-state area** - processor state is saved into the guest-state area on
  VM exits and loaded from there on VM entries.
* **Host-state area** - processor state is loaded from the host-state area on
  VM exits. It is usually saved only once when creating VMCS.
* **VM-execution control fields** - these fields control processor behaviour in
  VMX non-root operation. They determine in part the causes of VM exits.
* **VM-exit control fields** - these fields control VM exits.
* **VM-entry control fields** - these fields control VM entries.
* **VM-exit information fields** - these fields receive information on VM exits
  and describe the cause and the nature of VM exits. On some processors, these
  fields are read-only.

The VM-execution control fields, the VM-exit control fields, and the VM-entry
control fields are sometimes referred to collectively as VMX controls.

An overview of fields available in VMCS is available [here](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/cpu-internals/raw/master/VMCS.pdf).
Note that not all of those fields are available on all processors, also new ones
can be added in the future.

VMCS can be in one of six launch states, depending mostly on the last
VMCS-related instruction called:

![VMCS states](/img/vmcs_states.png)

VM can migrate between cores; in this case, VMCS can be reused on another core,
but only after it was brought out of *launched* state and flushed to memory.
VMCLEAR instruction does exactly that. Despite its name, it does not clear any
fields, except for changing VMCS's state, but this field isn't accessible
anyway.

Size of VMCS is limited to 4 kB, but it can have pointers to other structures.
These pointers contain physical addresses because some of them are needed
before CR3 can be loaded. All of that memory should remain hidden from VMs.

## Summary

I hope that this post described what VMM and VM is from developers (and
hardware) point of view. VM entry and VM exit are closely related to VMCS, it's
difficult to explain them separately. All important fields of VMCS will be
described at the time when they will be used.

Next post will show how to build Bareflank without any special treatment of
VM exits. We will also start OS from it and show that it is still usable, and
what is different than it was on real hardware.
