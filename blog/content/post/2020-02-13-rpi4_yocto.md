Minimal image for the fastest RPI in history
How to build a kernel? [Properly]
Minimal Image, Fastest Rpi, Quick Tutorial



Since it's release Raspberry had a huge impact on the industry. "A low cost,
credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV capable
of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the
internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets,
word-processing, and playing games." Especially the third generation which
reached approximately 6mln seles per year. 

## Is a new model the game changer? 

The Raspberry Pi 4 takes Pi to another level, with the performance that’s good
 enough to use in a pinch as a desktop PC. The company claims that the new
model is able to handle 4k video at 60Hz or power dual monitors.

It's not a hollow statement. Many tests proved that there's a huge leap
between the third and fourth generations. A Linpack offers a glimpse at just how
 far the Raspberry Pi family has come. Roy Longbottom version of a synthetic
 benchmark measures parameters such as: the fast single-precision,
 double-precision and a single-precision accelerated by NEON instruction
available since Raspberry Pi 2. From a benchmark perspective, we can notice
a tremendous increase in performance over Pi 3B+ model:
* 4x greate CPU performance
* 2x faster browsing speed
* 50% more fps while playing Quake III!

Among other countless changes in performance, such as: improved Memory
bandwidth, faster GPIO switching, better file compression. First time in
history raspberry offers customizability. Now we can choose between 1,2 and
even 4GB of RAM

Yocto for rpi4

TODO - describe a goal (e.g. building a minimal image in yocto for rpi4)

Before we start make sure that all required tools are installed. Type: 
``` 
$ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib
build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm python
```
to install missing packages. 

At this point, we can start for real. First of all, let's download Yocto then
 switch to the "zeus" branch which is the newest community version of Yocto
 at the time of writing this post.
```
mkdir Yocto
cd Yocto
git clone -b zeus http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
```
When cloning is finished we need to create a build directory and set up all the
 environmental variables, paths, etc. It can be obtained by typing

```
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
```
Yocto repository contains an extremally useful layer containing board support
 package called meta-raspberry pi that we need to add to our working directory
```
cd ~/Yocto
git clone -b zeus git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
```

Before we build we need to make some changes in crucial configuration files
Let's start from editing `bblayers.conf` located in `~/Yocto/poky/build`.
This file tells bitbake about the location of various layers locations which
are used to configure things like the target of a build and the location of
output files. 

Fist of all we need to add `meta-raspberrypi` layer we
can do that by appending it to BBLAYERS. The resault should look like this
```
BBLAYERS ?= " \
<projectPath>/Yocto/poky/meta \
<projectPath>/Yocto/poky/meta-poky \
<projectPath>/Yocto/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
<projectPath>/Yocto/meta-raspberrypi \
" 
```

Then let's move to editing another file in the same directory. This time
we dive into local.conf which is one of the most important files where
many changes take place.

First of all, we have to specify the machine on which we are working on.
To do that just edit line containing `MACHINE ??=` to look like this:

```
MACHINE ??= "raspberrypi4-64.conf" 
```
in the same file, we can also add information about a number of threads 
used to build an image. So append the file following lines (ideally) at
 the end of the local.conf:
```
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4" 
``` 
At this point, we are able to build an image but it would require some
additional steps during flashing the image. By adding just a few lines we can
make huge improvements:

First of all, we can apply some features already provided by meta-raspberrypi.
If we inspect `sdimage-raspberrypi.wks` file located in
`Yocto/meta-raspberrypi/wic` we can see the following lines:

```
# short-description: Create Raspberry Pi SD card image
# long-description: Creates a partitioned SD card image for use with
# Raspberry Pi. Boot files are located in the first vfat partition.

part /boot --source bootimg-partition --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=vfat --label boot --active --align 4096 --size 20
part / --source rootfs --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=ext4 --label root --align 4096
```
If we add this to our project, an image will automatically create required
partitions for boot and root on SD card after flashing. To provide that
functionality everything we have to do is to append two lines to the local.conf

```
WKS_FILE = "sdimage-raspberrypi.wks"
```
This will tells Yocto to add `sdimage-raspberrypi.wks` to the project. And the
 second line which is responsible for creating two compressed output files.
```
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "wic.gz wic.bmap"
```
To save some time in the future we can also make Yocto responsible for enabling
 uart what we will need in the future, so append to local.conf following line:
```
ENABLE_UART = "1"
```

That's it. Now we can use Bitbake to build the image.
```
cd ~/Yocto/poky
source oe-init-build-env
bitbake core-image-minimal
```
If everything was succesful w should see message simillar to this:
```

```

Now among many files located in `/Yocto/poky/build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64`
 we can find the result of our build. The easiest way to do that is to type:

```
find . -print | grep 'wic'
```
this will show as much fewer files where
```
./core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bmap
./core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.gz
```
are files that we will use in a moment.

Now we can insert the SD card to PC and necessarily check it's location e.g. by
using:
```
sudo find . -print
```
It will look like this:
```
Disk /dev/sdd: 14,9 GiB, 15931539456 bytes, 31116288 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x076739e0
```

It's important as a flashing image to the wrong location may cause serious
damage. To do that we need one more tool called `bmap-tools`. If it's not
already installed you can do that by typing:
```
sudo apt-get install -y bmap-tools
```
Then just:
```
sudo bmaptool copy --bmap core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bmap
core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.gz /dev/sd[X]
```
, where [X] is the location of a SD card.

We can now see the results by powering on raspberry and connecting it via uart
to PC. Then type
```
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200
```
Then press enter and log as a root.
