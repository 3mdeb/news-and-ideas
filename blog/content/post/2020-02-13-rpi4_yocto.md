Since it's release Raspberry had a huge impact on the industry. "A low cost,
credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV capable
of doing everything you'd expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the
internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets,
word-processing, and playing games." Especially the third generation which
reached approximately 6mln sales per year.

## Is a new model the game changer

The Raspberry Pi 4 takes Pi to another level, with the performance that's good
enough to use in a pinch as a desktop PC. The company claims that the new
model is able to handle 4k video at 60Hz or power dual monitors.

It's not a hollow statement. Many tests proved that there's a huge leap
between the third and fourth generations. A Linpack offers a glimpse at just how
far the Raspberry Pi family has come. Roy Longbottom version of a synthetic
benchmark measures parameters such as: the fast single-precision,
double-precision and a single-precision accelerated by NEON instruction
available since Raspberry Pi 2. From a benchmark perspective, we can notice
a tremendous increase in performance over Pi 3B+ model:

* 4x greater CPU performance
* 2x faster browsing speed
* 50% more fps while playing Quake III!

Among other countless changes in performance, such as: improved Memory
bandwidth, faster GPIO switching, better file compression. First time in
history Raspberry offers customizability. Now we can choose between 1,2 and
even 4GB of RAM

## Building minimal image with Yocto

Following a rule of embedded systems saying not to build things that you will
never use, we are going to build a core-minimal-image. It's an image with an
extremely small footprint and its a great thing to start with.

All actions will be performed on Ubuntu 18.04. Before we start make sure that
all required tools are installed and that you have enough free space on the
system, it is safe to have at least 50gb of free space. To install needed
packages type:

```
sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm python
```

The most common tool to connect with Raspberry is UART interface. It will be
also used in this post. I also use USB Type-C to power up the device. At this
point, we can start for real. First of all, let's download Yocto then switch to
the "zeus" branch which is the newest community version of Yocto at the time of
writing this post.

```
cd ~
mkdir Yocto && cd Yocto
git clone -b zeus http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
```

When cloning is finished we need to create a build directory and set up all the
environmental variables, paths, etc. It can be obtained by typing:

```
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
```

Yocto repository contains an extremally useful layer containing board support
a package called meta-raspberrypi that we need to add to our working directory

```
cd ~/Yocto
git clone -b zeus git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
```

Before we build we need to make some changes in crucial configuration files.
Let's start from editing `bblayers.conf` located in `~/Yocto/poky/build/conf`.
This file tells bitbake about the location of various layers locations which
are used to configure things like the target of a build and the location of
output files.

First of all we need to add `meta-raspberrypi` layer we
can do that by appending it to BBLAYERS. The result should look like this

```
BBLAYERS ?= " \
<projectPath>/Yocto/poky/meta \
<projectPath>/Yocto/poky/meta-poky \
<projectPath>/Yocto/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
<projectPath>/Yocto/meta-raspberrypi \
"
```

Then let's move to editing another file in the same directory. This time
we dive into `local.conf` which is one of the most important files where
many changes take place.

First of all, we have to specify the machine on which we are working on.
To do that just edit line containing `MACHINE ??=` to look like this:

```shell
MACHINE ??= "raspberrypi4-64"
```

By default image's build runs on number of CPU threads available on given
platform but if you want you can change that value to e.g. 8 threads by simply
append these two lines to `local.conf`:

```shell
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "8"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 8"
```

At this point, we are able to build an image but it would require some
additional steps during flashing the image. By adding just a few lines we can
make huge improvements:

First of all, we can apply some features already provided by `meta-raspberrypi`.
If we inspect `sdimage-raspberrypi.wks` file located in
`Yocto/meta-raspberrypi/wic` we can see the following lines:

```shell
# short-description: Create Raspberry Pi SD card image
# long-description: Creates a partitioned SD card image for use with
# Raspberry Pi. Boot files are located in the first vfat partition.

part /boot --source bootimg-partition --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=vfat --label boot --active --align 4096 --size 20
part / --source rootfs --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=ext4 --label root --align 4096
```

If we add this to our project, an image will automatically create required
partitions for boot and root on SD card after flashing. To provide that
functionality everything we have to do is to add two lines to the `local.conf`

```shell
WKS_FILE = "sdimage-raspberrypi.wks"
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "wic.gz wic.bmap"
```

This will tells Yocto to use `sdimage-raspberrypi.wks` file when creating a disk
image and create compressed disk image `wic.gz` and `wic.bmap` which is a block
map file.

To save some time in the future we can also make Yocto responsible for enabling
UART what we will need in the future, so add to `local.conf` following line:

```shell
ENABLE_UART = "1"
```

That's it. Now we can use BitBake to build the image.

```shell
cd ~/Yocto/poky
source oe-init-build-env
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

If everything was successful we should see message simillar to this:

```shell

```

Now among many files located in
`Yocto/poky/build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64` we can find the ones which
we will use to flash SD card. The easiest way to do that is to type:

```shell
$ ls *wic*
core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64-20200305115040.rootfs.wic.bmap  core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bmap
core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64-20200305115040.rootfs.wic.gz    core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.gz
```

Where `core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bmap` and
`core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.gz` are symbolic links that we are going
to use.

Now we can insert the SD card to PC and necessarily check it's location e.g. by
using:

```shell
sudo fdisk -l
```

It will look like this:

```shell
Disk /dev/sdc: 29,7 GiB, 31914983424 bytes, 62333952 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x008b235e
```

It's important as flashing an image to the wrong location may cause serious
damage. To do that we need one more tool called `bmap-tools`. If it's not
already installed you can do that by typing:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y bmap-tools
```

Then we need to unmount our SD card and flash an image with `bmaptool` command.

```shell
sudo umount /dev/sd[X]
sudo bmaptool copy --bmap core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bmap core-image-minimal-raspberrypi4-64.wic.gz /dev/sd[X]
```

, where [X] is the location of a SD card.

We can now see the results by powering on raspberry and connecting it via UART
to PC. Then type

```shell
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200
```

Then press enter and log in as root.
