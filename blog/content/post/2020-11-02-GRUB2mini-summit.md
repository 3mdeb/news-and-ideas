### Introduction

Sometimes we should stop and look at the tools without which it would be
difficult to even imagine everyday work. Some of them are so essential, that to
avoid them means to develop a wheel once again in the history. Such a tool in
the world of firmware – along with keyboard, fridge and linux – is a dwarf that
became synonymous with the word bootloader. And by dwarf I mean of course GRUB.

Last December, we've met with our friend, Daniel Kiper, GRUB upstream maintainer
and TrenchBoot technical leader inside Oracle. This meeting resulted in
organization of GRUB minisummit 2019, because we wanted to understand a vision
of both, GRUB/GRUB2 community and commercial perspective. All the event was
fruitful and grounded some common path that will be slightly summarized below.
This year we cannot miss this opportunity to meet again and face the new
challenges of GRUB/GRUB2. Dear reader, feel invited to look with us at GRUB2
through a magnifying glass.

##### Day 3

This time we've had a pleasure to host Patrick Rudolph from 9elements and Daniel
Kiper from Oracle.

- [XHCI support in GRUB2](https://youtu.be/SSrFv4a-zgU) by Patrick Rudolph
- [The Firmware and Bootloader log specification](https://youtu.be/SSrFv4a-zgU?t=2806)
  by Daniel Kiper

Big kudos for our special guests. Thank you Daniel Kiper, Daniel Axtens and
Patrick Rudolph for sharing your experience and knowledge with us during the
meetings with GRUB.

### Where to link the event?

You will find us on our YouTube 3mdeb channel. All you need to do is joining our
live [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_djHbyjuJvhVjfT18nyqmQ/live) in an
appropriate time presented above. **We are starting tomorrow at 04:00 PM
(UTC+1:00)**.

### Whom will you meet?

Prelections will be held by the team of experts and GRUB contributors from
3mdeb, Oracle, IBM and 9elements who are happy to answer intriguing questions
and share their passion without creating any marketing pitch.

The GRUB bootloader is the most common bootloader in the Linux based operating
systems. So, its further development requires close cooperation between
upstream maintainers, OS distributions and other users. The GRUB mini-summit
is a very good place to tighten it. We are going to discuss there current and
future GRUB developments but also challenges facing the project. The topics
not only cover technical aspects but also organizational and legal issues. If
you are interested in the bootloaders and firmware and you want to hear what
is happening in the GRUB world please join us. And we are also interested in
hearing what you expect from the project...
> -- Daniel Kiper, GRUB maintainer, TrenchBoot technical leader at Oracle

There are no enough evets discussing interfaces between firmware, bootloaders,
and operating systems, especially in the light of recent vulnerabilities and
evolution of firmware interfaces. 3mdeb co-organizing this event with Daniel
Kiper (GRUB maintainer), we would like to raise awareness about the value
produced in the effect of community and business collaboration. We also would
like to build a platform to discuss the interface between firmware and
bootloader, bootloader feature set and issues, and the interface between
bootloader and OS. We hope this activity will convince silicon vendors, their
OEMs/ODMs, and system developers that supporting the GRUB2 community can speed
up the adoption of advanced security and hardware features.
> -- Piotr Król, founder of 3mdeb

### GRUB mini-summit 2019

Last year we have decided to talk over some key issues:

- Redundant GRUB2 env file
- TPM support in GRUB2 for legacy boot mode
- overview of GRUB2 security features
- Python 3 support in GRUB2
- AMD TrenchBoot support in GRUB2

Thank you community for being there with us, for raising your voices and
fostering discussion that has it's reflection in GRUB2 contributions of 2020.
All the summary of raised issues you will find in our previous GRUB blogpost
[here](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2020/2020-02-19-grub2_and_3mdeb_minisummit/). We
are waiting tomorrow, once again for your perspective, ideas and voice. Let's
meet and talk over the important issues with GRUB/GRUB2 contributors. GRUB will
always be the core axe of 3mdeb toolbox.
