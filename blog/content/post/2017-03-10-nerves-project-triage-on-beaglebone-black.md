Recently one of my customers brought to my attention [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org).
It aims to simplify use of Elixir (functional language leveraging Erlang VM) in
embedded systems. This system has couple interesting features that are worth of
research and blog post.

First is booting directly to application which is running in BEAM (Erlang VM).
Nerves project replace systemd process with programming language virtual
machine running application code. Concept is very interesting and I wonder if
someone tried to use that with other VMs ie. JVM.

Second Nerves seems to utilize dual image update procedure. In my opinion any
development of modern embedded system should start with update system. Any
design that you can to your system update arsenal will be useful.

Third, Nerves use Buildroot as build system, which will I'm familiar with.
Using popular build systems means simplified support for huge set of platforms
(at point of writing this article Buildroot have 142 config files).

## Let's start with documentation

If you don't want to go through all [installation steps](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html)
and you use Debian testing, you can run:

```
sudo apt-get install erlang elixir ssh-askpass squashfs-tools \
git g++ libssl-dev libncurses5-dev bc m4 make unzip cmake
```

### Erlang

Checking exact Erlang version for non Erlang developers is trivial:

```
$ erl -eval '{ok, Version} = file:read_file(filename:join([code:root_dir(), \
"releases", erlang:system_info(otp_release), "OTP_VERSION"])), \
io:fwrite(Version), halt().' -noshell
19.2.1
```

### Elixir

Checking Elixir version:

```
$ elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [kernel-poll:false]

Elixir 1.3.3
```

Unfortunately Nerves Project requires at least `1.4.0`, what can be solved by:

```
sudo apt-get remove elixir
wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang/elixir/FLAVOUR_2_download/elixir_1.4.1-1\~debian\~jessie_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i elixir_1.4.1-1~debian~jessie_all.deb
$ elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [kernel-poll:false]

Elixir 1.4.1
```

### fwup
`fwup` have to be installed from `deb` package:

```
wget https://github.com/fhunleth/fwup/releases/download/v0.13.0/fwup_0.13.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i fwup_0.13.0_amd64.deb
```

I don't understand why Nerves Projects used `fwup`, when software like
`swupdate` from Denx is available. I don't see difference in feature set and
would say that `swupdate` is more flexible and covers more use cases. It looks
like Nerves Project is main user of `fwup`.

Maybe it would be worth to consider comparison of `fwup` and `swupdate` ?

### nerves_bootstrap

```
mix local.hex
mix local.rebar
mix archive.install https://github.com/nerves-project/archives/raw/master/nerves_bootstrap.ez
```

## hello_nerves for BeagleBone Black

```
mix nerves.new hello_nerves
export MIX_TARGET=bbb
cd hello_nerves
mix deps.get
mix firmware
```

### Flashing to SD card

```
mix firmware.burn -d /dev/sdX
```

### booting

It look that things work out of the box and Elixir started and D2 LED blinks
continuously.

## Nerves booting

It looks like developers configured Linux kernel `bootargs` used by U-Boot to
run `elrinit` as init process. `erlinit` is relatively simple application that
can parse configuration file and do some basic system initialization. Depending
on needs this may be considered quite weird approach. Of course adding
`systemd` is not best approach for all solutions. For sure having custom init
binary remove need for complex init system and makes updates much smaller. Also
this solution targets dedicated embedded systems that whole purpose is running
Elixir application.

Using custom init binary also limit attack vector to small amount of code. In
typical build from Buildroot or Yocto final image contain quite a lot of
process run by default. Nerves limit that to one that is needed for very
specific use case that can be fully handled by Elixir application. Of course
still some hardware setup is needed. In that case only Linux kernel or Elixir
application can be attacked.

As one of my associate mention this is very similar approach to `Busybox`
although here we replace shell with Elixir interpreter, but idea is similar to
have one application that is entry point to the system.

From performance perspective this is also good solution since there a no
daemons working in background that consuming resources. Lack of additional
processes means that all server type of work have to be written in Elixir.

It would be very interesting to see how this approach can work for other VMs
and if there are real world use cases for that.

## erlinit & erlexec

`erlinit` is MIT licensed `/sbin/init` replacement. In general it:

* setup pseudo-filesystems like `/dev`, `/proc` and `/sys`
* setup serial console
* register signal hendlers (`SIGPWR`, `SIGUSR1`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGUSR2`)
* forks into cleanup process and new that start `erlexec`

`elrexec` is mix of C++ and Erlang that aim to control OS processes from Erlang
application.

Source code can be found on Github: [erlinit](https://github.com/nerves-project/erlinit) and [erlexec](https://github.com/saleyn/erlexec).


## Note about building natively

Recently I'm huge fan of containers and way this technology can be utilized by
embedded software developers. Installing all dependencies in your environment
is painful and can cause problems if you do not pay attention. Containers give
you ability to separate tools for each project. In that way you create one
`Dockerfile` for whole development environment and then share it with your
peers. I believe Nerves Project shall share containers to build system images
instead of maintaining documentation explaining how to setup development
for lot of various environments.

For example steps for Debian required more of jumping between pages and
googling then it was worth since correct set of packages solve issue.

## Summary

Do you plan to use Nerves in your next embedded systems project ? Maybe you
struggle with adapting similar approach for different VM ? Feel free to share
your ideas and issues in comments. If you think content valuable please share
this help us in providing more content to our blog.
