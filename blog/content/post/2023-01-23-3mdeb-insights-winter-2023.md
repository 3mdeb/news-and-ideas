This blog will provide an in-depth look at upcoming plans and events for the
near future. In the next quarter, we have several exciting events planned
for the 3mdeb community. Our events aim to provide a platform for members to
connect, share knowledge, and stay informed about the latest developments in
the open-source ecosystem.

## Upcoming events

### FOSDEM 2023

FOSDEM is a large, annual event for open-source software developers that
takes place in Brussels, Belgium on February 4th and 5th. It is an opportunity
for developers from all over the world to come together, share ideas, and
learn about the latest open-source technologies. 3mdeb will be participating
in FOSDEM and will be hosting an "Open Source Firmware, BMC, and Bootloader
Devroom" to showcase their contributions to the open-source ecosystem and
connect with other developers. Additionally, 3mdeb engineers will be present
to share their knowledge with attendees.

Tomasz Żyjewski will provide an overview of the Secure Boot feature on
ARM SoCs, which is a BootROM feature that allows for the verification of loaded
binaries before execution to prevent untrusted code from running on the
platform. The approach is similar across vendors, but this area has no
standardization. We will check the status of the Secure Boot feature from a year
ago and expand on it by describing examples on Rockchip and Mediatek-based
boards. This talk will help developers integrate Secure Boot into their
platforms for increased security in embedded devices.

Maciej Pijanowski will discuss the TwTPM project, which aims to increase the
trustworthiness of TPM modules by providing open-source firmware compliant
with TCG PC Client Specification. TPMs enable security features such as measured
boot and verified boot, but the market is dominated by proprietary firmware.
The presentation will detail the project's goals, design, challenges, and
status, also to gather a community and exchange ideas.

Michał Żygowski will cover recent news, updates from previous years,
and the current situation of coreboot. The talk will also discuss new
deprecations and the shift of platforms out of the main tree.
Michał will be discussing the history of AMD's cooperation in coreboot projects
and the current state of support for modern mobile Ryzen chips on Chromebook
devices. They will also present a plan for long-term, stable and sustainable
support for older platforms. The talk will cover the efforts of 3mdeb to
support the AMD platforms and the situation of maintaining PC Engines platforms.

### Dasharo User Group (DUG) #1

The Dasharo User Group (DUG) is an important forum for users of Dasharo to
come together, share their knowledge, and stay informed about the latest
developments in the Dasharo ecosystem. The DUG is a platform for users to
connect and learn about new features and updates that are coming to Dasharo.
The first DUG event will take place in early March and will include a variety
of discussions on different topics related to Dasharo. The agenda for the event
will be shared in the next month. The event will be a great opportunity for
Dasharo users to meet other users, learn new things, and share their
knowledge and experience with others.

### Dasharo Developers vPub 0x6

The Dasharo Developers vPub will be a follow-up event to DUG#1 and will
provide a space for developers to engage in more informal conversations
and discussions that may not have been covered during DUG#1. The vPub is
designed to be a less structured, more relaxed environment where developers
can discuss topics that are of interest to them. This can include off-topic
discussions, technical challenges they are facing, and ideas for new features
or improvements.

The vPub is open to all developers who are interested in Dasharo and want to
learn more about the platform. If you're curious about what was discussed in
previous vPubs, you can find a list of past topics on the Dasharo vPub
[archive page](https://vpub.dasharo.com/archive/). This will give you an idea
of the types of conversations that take place during the vPub and help you
decide if it's something you would like to participate in.

Overall, the Dasharo Developers vPub is an excellent opportunity for
developers to learn more about Dasharo and connect with other developers who
are working with the platform. Whether you're new to Dasharo or an
experienced developer, the vPub is open to everyone and provides a valuable
forum for learning and collaboration.
