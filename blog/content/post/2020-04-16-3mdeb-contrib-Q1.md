## Intro

Our mission @3mdeb is to develop secure and maintainable firmware and
applications helping our clients reach their goals. During everyday work
sometimes we struggle with frustrating problems that shouldn't occur in the
first place. When we finally deal with the issues, the first thing we want to do
is to share the good news with the related communities. This is our main
motivation behind our hard work - to share the knowledge by taking part in the
open source community and help developers and enthusiasts with samples of codes.
The positive feedback from the users is the priceless reward that drives us to
spread the habit of contributing to open source projects. This post will start
the series of 3mdeb contribution summary posts that will be released at the end
of each quarter. Let's dive into the world of open code!

## 2020'Q1 - the king of coreboot?

In the first 3 months of 2020, we contributed `7130` lines of code (except the
patches that have not been merged yet) getting in total over `16k`
[SLOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) in `34` unique
projects so far.

Let's introduce the new changes:

1. [coreboot](https://coreboot.org/)

    >  coreboot is an extended firmware platform that delivers a lightning fast
    >  and secure boot experience on modern computers and embedded systems. As
    >  an Open Source project it provides auditability and maximum control over
    >  technology.

    This project is the unquestioned number one in this overview - to sum up,
    the most significant changes:

## In the near future

We are not going to rest on our laurels. There are still plenty merge and pull
requests that are in the review state or marked as work in progress.

In the TrenchBoot/landing-zone project, 3mdeb's Firmware Team is working on
[Multiboot2][pr1] and [new kernel info structure][pr2]. If you are interested in
this project, check out posts describing our work on Open Source DRTM - [Project
basics](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2020/2020-03-31-trenchboot-nlnet-lz/) and
[Landing Zone validation](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2020/2020-04-03-trenchboot-nlnet-lz-validation/).

coreboot community is active as always and 3mdeb's team send support patches for
[Dell OptiPlex 9010 SFF][pr3], [SMSC SCH5545][pr4], [intel/bd82x6x missing power
button events][pr5], [SeaBIOS fix][pr6] and intruder detection system
([patch1][pr7], [patch2][pr8], [patch3][pr9])! Below you can find a little
demonstration what it is all about:

## Last but not least news

Do you want to read more about our contribution? Feeling that you are missing
information about open projects that we are developing and maintaining? Finally,
we can announce that all open source related activities and achievements are
available to visit at newly created subdomain
[opensource.3mdeb.com](https://opensource.3mdeb.com/).

Feel free to comment on which projects missing out there and we will surely look
into the details of pointed technologies. Also, if you have any questions
regarding the basics of the contribution process or simply want to send your
first patches to the world of the open source IT but you lack the courage to do
so, we will be glad to help you out.

## Summary

Do you still hesitate to be a part of the open source community? By contribution
you not only share valuable code but also improve your software through review
of experienced community members. Take part in the act of learning and teaching
by explaining how you do things in the example project and build a reputation
around people who are interested in similar things. Do not wait and join the
open source family!

If you think we can help in improving the security of your firmware or you
looking for someone who can boost your product by leveraging advanced features
of a used hardware platform, feel free to [book a call with
us](https://calendly.com/3mdeb/consulting-remote-meeting) or drop us email to
