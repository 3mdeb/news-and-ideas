# About the Fobnail Token project

The Fobnail Token is a project that aims to provide a reference architecture for
building offline integrity measurement servers on the USB device and clients
running in Dynamically Launched Measured Environments (DLME). It allows the
Fobnail owner to verify the trustworthiness of the running system before
performing any sensitive operation. This project was founded by [NlNet
Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/). More information about the project can be found
in the [Fobnail documentation](https://fobnail.3mdeb.com/). Also, make sure to
