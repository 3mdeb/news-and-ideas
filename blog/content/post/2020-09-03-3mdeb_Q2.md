## Intro

Another quarter is ahead of us. It was a profitable time in 3mdeb during
which we were focusing on development of secure and maintainable
firmware and software. During all this time we were in touch with the
community, sharing good news as well as frustrating issues that have cost us a
lot of struggle. The time has passed quickly, many issues has been solved and
many patches has been released. We are glad that we can again share our contributions to the open
source project, summing up recent three months of our open work. Let's have a look!

## 2020'Q2 - the open code matters

In the second 3 months of 2020, we contributed `4352` lines of code (except the
patches that have not been merged yet) getting in total over `17,5k`
[SLOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) in `34` unique
projects so far.

## Our contributions:

2. [TrenchBoot/landing-zone](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/landing-zone/)

    > TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build
    > security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems.
    > The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that
    > establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of
    > confidence that integrity actions were not subverted.

    Author          | Category | Patch | URL
    ----------------|----------|-------|----
    Krystian Hebel  | Build    | support kernels with embedded initramfs   | [link](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/landing-zone/pull/54)
    Krystian Hebel  | Build    | Tpm unmerge | [link](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/landing-zone/pull/53)

Code for TPM support no longer consists of one big, merged file, it uses the
original form of tpmlib instead. It is included as a git submodule, which should
make it easier to keep up to date.

3. [chirpstack-gateway-os](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-os/)

    > ChirpStack Gateway OS is an open-source Linux based embedded OS which can run on
    > various LoRa® gateway models. The goal is to make it easy to get started with
    > LoRaWAN® and the ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack with the
    > minimum steps required to setup your gateway(s).

     Patch released in 2020'Q2:

     Author          | Category | Patch | URL

    Maciej Pijanowski | Build   | Update to dunfell | [link](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-os/commit/a8170775aaadb108f2078aa213adcde37e4a6da8)

We have updated the chirpstack-gateway-os to the latest Yocto release (dunfell)
and improved chirpstack Golang Yocto recipies in order to avoid shipping
binaries.

## In the future

We are keep progressing, having interesting merge and pull requests that are in
the review state or marked as work in progress. We will be developing
**TrenchBoot/landing-zone** project, working on [Multiboot2](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/landing-zone/pull/28), [Event log](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/landing-zone/pull/52), and [Headers redesign](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/landing-zone/pull/56).
