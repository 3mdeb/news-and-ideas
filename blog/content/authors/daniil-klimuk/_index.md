Programming, electronics and cycling nerd, bookworm and very passionate in
learning. Left his own country at seventeen years old for studying and working
abroad, and still searching for a place to settle. Big critic of fatalism and a
fan of what-you-are-is-what-you-do way of thinking.

In professional life tries to be as pedantic as possible, believes that nothing
is perfect and nobody is perfect and every solution should be questioned and
evaluated. Likes to solve complex problems, even if it implies a lot of digging
before stating the final solution. States that developing skills in different
fields is important as well as perfecting a one field, because everything has
its intersections and sometimes it is crucial to investigate something from a
different angle.

Most of the time a workaholic, but sometimes a bit lazy. Not always punctual and
often unconsciously altruistic.
