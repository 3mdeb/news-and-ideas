I'm into open-source firmware, drawing inspiration from the classic hacker
ethos of collaborative innovation and transparency. At 3mdeb, we're excited
about our two main projects: Zarhus OS, an Embedded Linux distribution based on
Yocto, and Dasharo, a coreboot downstream. Both are about the value of open
development, embedded firmware resilience, platform security transparency, the
right to repair, and digital sovereignty.

Community is at the center of our activity. By being involved in the Dasharo
Users Group, Dasharo Developers vPub, and events like the Qubes OS Summit, we
connect with others who share our passion for open-source. Our efforts with
OpenSecurityTraining2 reflect our commitment to sharing knowledge and improving
the open-source firmware ecosystem.

As the founder of 3mdeb, my daily tasks go beyond managing the company. I am
also responsible for making important decisions about our products, such as
Zarhus OS and Dasharo, and developing valuable processes that establish a
foundation for projects we undertake for our clients.

Outside work, I enjoy simple pleasures like chess, bridge, and reading. Nature,
especially the peace of the forest, is where I find solace. My interests in
theology, philosophy, and psychology keep me curious about the world. Whether
it's exploring new technologies or understanding complex ideas, I'm always
eager to learn and grow.
