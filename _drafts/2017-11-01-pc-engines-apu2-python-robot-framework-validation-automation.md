Recently we attended <a href="https://ecc2017.coreboot.org/">ECC2017</a> conference. One
of topics that we considered was a system for development and validation
automation. Unfortunately this talk was not accepted, but we present some
research below and plan to provide more soon.

As maintainers of PC Engines platforms in coreboot we debug and fix quite a lot
of bugs, but to take full responsibility for our code everything should be
validated each time we do release. Limited resources lead us to automation and
as Python enthusiasts we decided to evaluate Robot Framework as first candidate.

When preparing to mentioned conference I found that we lack PXE server from
which I could run or install needed OSes. Also there was no ready to use
configuration that gave ability to utilize diskless boot and try recent Linux.
I started to fight with PXE server configuration, but then I realized that
without DHCP I have to provide booting information every time typing in iPXE
shell or integrate custom script. In long term those were not good solutions.

<h2>Robot Framework first try</h2>

Project by itself seems to be very popular and at first glance is well
designed. It gives ability to leverage enormous amount of Python libraries and
has integrated most important ones. I decided to start with installation in
virtualenv:

<pre><code class="shell">[23:00:11] pietrushnic:storage $ virtualenv robot-venv
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python2
New python executable in /home/pietrushnic/storage/robot-venv/bin/python2

</code></pre>

Verification:

<pre><code class="shell">(robot-venv) [23:00:46] pietrushnic:storage $ robot --version
Robot Framework 3.0.2 (Python 2.7.13 on linux2)
</code></pre>

<h2>Quick start guide</h2>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install docutils
git clone https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide.git
cd QuickStartGuide
robot QuickStart.rst
</code></pre>

Output should look like this:

<pre><code>==============================================================================

</code></pre>

What is great about that? Output is clean and can be easily understood. In
addition it generates log and report. Both generated files are clean and
eye-catching.

<h2>Let's try something real on PC Engines APU2</h2>

My typical output on minicom during boot was:

<pre><code>PC Engines apu2
coreboot build 07/18/2017
BIOS version
4080 MB ECC DRAM

SeaBIOS (version rel-1.10.2.1)
Press F10 key now for boot menu, N for PXE boot
</code></pre>

After <code>N for PXE boot</code> show script should send <code>N</code> or <code>n</code> what should send me
to <code>iPXE&gt;</code> prompt.

Initially I thought about using
<a href="https://github.com/whosaysni/robotframework-seriallibrary">robotframework-seriallibrary</a>,
but limitation led me to search for different solution.
<code>robotframework-seriallibrary</code> was designed to handle single byte communication
not serial output streams from operating system. For example <code>read_until</code>
function check for termination character, instead of matching string pattern,
what was expected during iPXE testing.

<code>ser2net</code> and <code>telnet</code> solution was suggested on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/robotframework-users/r0xvLtGNgno/TI0suLOlNL4J">mailing list</a>
and eventually was much better choice for my use case.

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ser2net
</code></pre>

Quick test with config file <code>ser2net_apu.cfg</code>

<pre><code>13542:telnet:600:/dev/ttyUSB0:115200 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT
</code></pre>

To prove that <code>ser2net</code> works correctly:

<pre><code>[0:19:39] pietrushnic:pcengines $ telnet localhost 13542
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
PC Engines apu2
coreboot build 07/18/2017
BIOS version
4080 MB ECC DRAM


telnet&gt; q
Connection closed.
</code></pre>

<h3>Telnet module for Robot Framework</h3>

After playing some time I got to point when I can enter iPXE command prompt. My
test looks pretty simple:

<pre><code class="robot">*** settings ***
Library    Telnet

*** Test Cases ***
Enter PXE with 'n'
    Open Connection    localhost    port=13542
    Set Encoding    errors=strict
    Set Timeout    30
    Read Until    N for PXE boot
    Write Bare    n
    Read Until    Booting from ROM
    Read Until    autoboot
    # move arrow up
    Write Bare    x1b[A
    Read Until    autoboot
    Write Bare    n
    Read Until    iPXE&gt;
</code></pre>

Most complex part was related to pushing arrow keys through terminal. Magic is
in <code>x1b[A</code> what triggers escape sequence matching arrow up key on keyboard. Other keys are:

<pre><code>x1b[B - down key
x1b[C - right key
x1b[D - left key
</code></pre>

<h2>Debugging pxelinux booting</h2>

Serial console handling in Robot Framework is not trivial task. Especially, if
You are doing it first time. What I learned is that below parameters are critical
to correct understand what is going on behind the scene:

<ul>
<li>enable debug log by using <code>-b &lt;file&gt;</code> parameter</li>
<li>set debug level <code>-L &lt;level&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

Command for running framework should look like that:

<pre><code>robot -b debug.log -L TRACE &lt;script_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>iPXE on apu2</h3>

I tried to create Robot Framework script, but faced weird issue when trying to
send more then one character. I described my findings in <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/robotframework-users/5Mf2rKns13s/XQbalZ_DAQAJ">this email</a>.
As I wrote it happens that <code>Telnet.write()</code> function is too fast and iPXE
cannot handle incoming characters. It took couple hours to figure it out and
without debugging output it would not be possible.

<h2>Booting pxelinux on apu2 using Robot Framework</h2>

Finally I managed to boot to iPXE shell and reliably send commands. Next step
was to provide an address of PXE server for downloading and booting purpose.

<h3>Setup PXE server for apu2</h3>

Communication with apu2 goes only through serial console or ssh when service is
ready, because of that typical Debian netboot had to be modified. In addition
to that I decided to create bigger booting menu, based on netboot package, for
various systems so You can see little bit different structure in future.

To setup PXE server easy way please follow:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/3mdeb/pxe-server.git
cd pxe-server
git clone https://github.com/3mdeb/netboot.git
NETBOOT_DIR=./netboot ./init.sh
</code></pre>

At point of writing this blog post support was very limited and menu had just
Debian i386 installer.

<h3>Full Robot Framework script</h3>

Below is my full script. Please note that I'm using custom method <code>Write Bare
Slow</code>. This is because of flaw related to slow iPXE input. To use this code You
can utilize our fork of <a href="https://github.com/3mdeb/robotframework">robotframework</a>.

<pre><code>*** settings ***
Library    Telnet

*** Test Cases ***
Enter iPXE shell
    # provide ser2net port where serial was redirected
    Open Connection    localhost    port=%{S2N_PORT}
    Set Encoding    errors=strict
    Set Timeout    30
    # find string indicating network booting is enabled
    Read Until    N for PXE boot
    # use n/N to enter network boot menu
    Write Bare    n
    Read Until    Booting from ROM
    Read Until    autoboot
    # move arrow up to choose iPXE shell position
    # https://github.com/pcengines/apu2-documentation/blob/master/ipxe/menu.ipxe
    Write Bare    x1b[A
    Read Until    autoboot
    # press enter
    Write Bare    n
    # make sure we are inside iPXE shell
    Read Until    iPXE&gt; x1b[?25h

Download and boot pxelinux
    # request IP address
    Write Bare Slow  dhcp net0n
    Read Until    ok
    Read Until    iPXE&gt;
    # provide pxelinux filename on PXE server
    Write Bare Slow  set filename pxelinux.0n
    Read Until    iPXE&gt;
    # provide PXE server IP address
    Write Bare Slow  set next-server %{PXE_SRV_IP}n
    Read Until    iPXE&gt;
    # download and boot pxelinux
    Write Bare Slow  chain tftp://${next-server}/${filename}n
    Read Until    PXE server boot menu
    Close Connection
</code></pre>

Configuration for <code>ser2net</code> port and PXE server IP address are passed through
environment variables.

<h2>Automated PXE booting</h2>

Assuming Your PXE server works fine You can run:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/pcengines/apu-test-suite.git
cd apu-test-suite
sudo ser2net -c ser2net_apu.cfg
</code></pre>

Then please change port and IP address accordingly:

<pre><code>S2N_PORT=13542 PXE_SRV_IP=&lt;IP_ADDR&gt; robot -b debug.log -L TRACE pxe_boot.robot
</code></pre>

Please note that port is hardcoded in ser2net_apu.cfg.

Output in terminal should look like this:

<pre><code>==============================================================================
Pxe Boot                                                                      
==============================================================================

</code></pre>

This means PXE boot menu is already in Your telnet, to connect to it simply
type:

<pre><code>telnet localhost 13542
</code></pre>

After refreshing Your screen with <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;-L</code> You should see boot menu:

![pxe_server_menu](https://3mdeb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pxe_server_menu.png">&lt;img src="/assets/images/pxe_server_menu.png)

Moreover You can investigate in details what happened using automatically
generated HTML page:

<h2>Summary</h2>

Why bother? Firmware debugging effort consists of tons of repeatable tasks.
Lots of them can be automated. Even if debugging is finished and problem was root
caused and fixed, we should make sure it will never return. That's why if we
face hacking session with big number of debug-code-test cycle we should think
about automation as soon as possible.

I tried to build PXE server for apu2 platform many times and always failed
running out of time. Typical booting cycle took me ~90s, automated environment
does it in 37s. This is not blasting result, but automation gives me solid
ground for growing further test case and keep me away from typing mistakes.

If You have any comments or problems related to above blog post please let us
know we would be glad to help You. If You are trying to automate Your embedded
device validation we would be glad to hear more about that.
