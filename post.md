Recently we started preparation of coreboot training for one of our customers.
Out platform of choice for that training is MinnowBoard Turbot. There are
couple reasons for that:

* during training we can show recent firmware trends - despite we don't like
  blobs (FSP, AGESA, PSP, ME etc.) and bloated designs (UEFI) we cannot escape
  reality and have to show customers how to deal with those components.
  MonnowBoard Turbot use couple of them, but also support coreboot.

* we can present recent Intel SoC features - MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-Core has
  Intel Atom E3826 which support for VT-x, TXE, PCU (Platform Control Unity),
  JTAG and other features that can be very interesting from firmware engineer
  point of view

* we can use platform which is used as reference design for various products -
  it looks like market for BayTrail (and newer Intel platforms) is quite big
  and there are many companies that develop solutions based on it

MinnowBoard was also used in UEFI security related trainings in which we are
really interested in.

Key problem with presentation and workshop preparation was need for SF100 as
SPI programmer. This tool is high quality, but is quite expensive. When we add
it to cost of MinnoBoard, equipment and shipping we end up with cost of one
development environment ~530USD (MinnowBoard Turbot: 200USD, SF100: 230USD,
peripherals+power supply: 50USD, shipping: 50USD). If we want to have 3-4
developers working on that project we end up spending >2k USD, which is not
negligible cost.

Obviously in this case DediProg is first component to cut price. DediProg is
high quality hardware and truly we not always need to bleeding edge quality. It
was already proven, that accepting longer flashing time, we may have hardware
solution that is much cheaper. Namely we can utilize Raspberry Pi 3 what reduce
cost to 46USD and using RPi Zero W reduce that to 7USD.

So the purpose of below blog post is to use RPi Zero W (RPiZW) as flasher for
MinnowBoard Turbo and possibly other platforms. This is nothing new as many
times this procedures were described on various RPi versions.

# RPiZW preparation

Get recent [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). In
this guide I used `2017-09-07` version. Flash it on SD card and boot system. I
used to use USB to TTY converter so serial console configuration was needed. To
do that modfiy `config.txt` on boot partition of Raspbian with below entry and
end of file:

```
# Enable UART
enable_uart=1
```

Next you have to setup WiFi. Easiest way is through modification of
[wpa_supplicant.conf](https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/raspberry-pi-zerow-headless-wifi-setup.html).

Please note that `wpa_supplicant` is not started automatically without
additional configuration, so it is good to add below configuration to
`/etc/network/interfaces`:

```
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
```

After reboot your WiFi should be connected.

# Flashrom compilation

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flashrom
```

# Electrical considerations

Minnowboard Turbot B uses `Winbond Electronics W25Q64BVSSIG` memory. This chip
requires power supply voltage range 2.7V - 3.6V. The energy needed to power
this memory may come from the internal power circuit of Minnowboard Turbot B or
by connecting the voltage to the pin 1 of J1 MinnowBoard header. In each of
these cases the current flowing from the power source flows through the `NXP
Semiconductors BAT754C` Schottky barrier diode, which causes 0.6V voltage drop.
Therefore, it is necessary to supply a voltage of at least 3.3V to properly
supply the memory chip.

`Winbond Electronics W25Q64BVSSIG` has `WP` and `HOLD` input pins. The first of
them activates write protect state. The second one pauses device even if it is
selected by SPI `CS` pin. `WP` and `HOLD` are activated by a low logical state.
Both inputs are pulled-up to the power line. Therefore, when 3.3V is applied to
the 1 pin of J1 header write protect and pause states are disabled due to the
presence of a high logical state on `WP` and `HOLD` inputs. This is required
when we want to flash memory chip via SPI bus using external device. If it is
J1 header pin 1 not connected voltage present on power supply line may be
floating. It may cause problems to read and write data to the `W25Q64BVSSIG`
memory chip.

Minnowboard Turbot B external SPI bus operates on voltages in the range 0V -
3.3V, although the SOC used in Turbot B requires a voltage not exceeding 1.8 V.
It happens because `NXP Semiconductors NTB0104` dual supply translating
transceiver mediates between the SPI buses. This device changes voltage levels
to the right values for each bus. `NTB0104` chip has `OE` input, which
corresponds to whether the signals are transmitted on the 1.8 V side. For a
high logical state signals are transmitted, for a low logical state not. `OE`
input is connected to J1 header 8 pin of Minnowboard Turbot B and it is pulled
up to 1.8V power supply line. Therefore, when we want to make sure that the bus
is isolated from SOC, it is advisable to short pin 8 with ground. Then we
communicate on SPI bus only with the `Winbond Electronics W25Q64BVSSIG` memory
chip.

# Wiring

![rpizw_mb_wiring](http://3mdeb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rpizw_mb_wiring.jpg)

It is hard to explain that without nice drawing tool, but I will try with the
table and above picture:

|RPi Z W pin on J8 | MinnowBoard pin on J1 | wire color |
|---|---|---|
| Pin 1 - 3V3 OUT | Pin 1 - DDP_VCC| red |
| Pin 9 - GND | Pin 2 - GND| black |
| Pin 24 - SPI CS0 | Pin 3 - DDP_CS | green |
| Pin 23 - SPI SCLK | Pin 4 - DDP_CLK | blue |
| Pin 21 - SPI MISO | Pin 5 - DDP_MISO | orange |
| Pin 19 - SPI MOSI | Pin 6 - DDP_MOSI | yellow |

# Running flashrom read

```
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 -r mb.rom
```

It is good practice to read couple times and confirm that we reading the same
binary. We faced some problems when `HOLD#` and `WP#` were not pulled-up.

After reading, `binwalk` can be used to look inside binary:

```
sudo apt-get install binwalk
binwalk mb.rom

# Flashing coreboot binary

Easy way to bake coreboot binary on your workstation is using our
`coreboot-trainings-sdk` container:

```
docker pull 3mdeb/coreboot-trainings-sdk:1.50
git clone https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot
cd coreboot
git submodule update --init --checkout
cd ..
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/coreboot:/home/coreboot/coreboot \
coreboot/coreboot-sdk:1.50 /bin/bash
cd ~/coreboot
make menuconfig
```

Choose mainboard vendor (Intel) and model (Minnow Max), then go to Chipset and
choose `Use Intel Firmware Support Pakcage`.

```
make -j$(nproc)
```

Then copy `coreboot/build/coreboot.rom` to Raspberry Pi and flash:

```
echo 00500000:007fffff cb > 8mb.layout
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 -l 8mb.layout -i cb -w coreboot.rom
```

Disconnect wires after flashing.

After powering on MinnowBoard Turbot you should see serial output:

```

```

# Recovery procedure

If for some reason you will overwrite different regions then needed and you and
up with not bootable platform you can write stock firmware and reflash coreboot
again. For example:

```
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 \
-w MNW2MAX1.X64.0097.D01.1709211100.bin
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 -l 8mb.layout -i cb -w coreboot.rom
```

# Speed up flashing procedure

There is magic flashrom parameter `spispeed`. Value that it accepts depends on
hardware. RPi support max 125MHz, but MinnowBoard chip has max speed of 80MHz.
Typical flashing time without that parameter is ~6min and it happen that
default SPI speed is set to 512kHz, so changing it matters a lot.

```
time 
```

# Stability issues

Above solution is low cost as well as low quality. A lot depends on quality of
wires. Probably well fitted connectors would save a lot of headache.

RPiZW solution is also much slower, but if you need cheap alternative to SF100,
then some trade-offs have to be taken. Flashing time for full Intel binary is
~6min.

# Summary

I'm pretty sure that for most coreboot people this is not new stuff, but we
needed that post refreshed for beginners as well as for internal usage. It's
good to have all instructions in one place.
