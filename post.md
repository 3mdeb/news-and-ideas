Recently we started preparation of coreboot training for one of our customers.
Out platform of choice for that training is MinnowBoard Turbot. There are
couple reasons for that:

* during training we can show recent firmware trends - despite we don't like
  blobs (FSP, AGESA, PSP, ME etc.) and bloated designs (UEFI) we cannot escape
  reality and have to show customers how to deal with those components.
  MonnowBoard Turbot use couple of them, but also support coreboot.

* we can present recent Intel SoC features - MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-Core has
  Intel Atom E3826 which support for VT-x, TXE, PCU (Platform Control Unity),
  JTAG and other features that can be very interesting from firmware engineer
  point of view

* we can use platform which is used as reference design for various products -
  it looks like market for BayTrail (and newer Intel platforms) is quite big
  and there are many companies that develop solutions based on it

MinnowBoard was also used in UEFI security related trainings in which we are
really interested in.

Key problem with presentation and workshop preparation was need for SF100 as
SPI programmer. This tool is high quality, but is quite expensive. When we add
it to cost of MinnoBoard, equipment and shipping we end up with cost of one
development environment ~530USD (MinnowBoard Turbot: 200USD, SF100: 230USD,
peripherals+power supply: 50USD, shipping: 50USD). If we want to have 3-4
developers working on that project we end up spending >2k USD, which is not
negligible cost.

Obviously in this case DediProg is first component to cut price. DediProg is
high quality hardware and truly we not always need to bleeding edge quality. It
was already proven, that accepting longer flashing time, we may have hardware
solution that is much cheaper. Namely we can utilize Raspberry Pi 3 what reduce
cost to 46USD and using RPi Zero W reduce that to 7USD.

So the purpose of below blog post is to use RPi Zero W (RPiZW) as flasher for
MinnowBoard Turbo and possibly other platforms. This is nothing new as many
times this procedures were described on various RPi versions.

# RPiZW preparation

Get recent [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). In
this guide I used `2017-09-07` version. Flash it on SD card and boot system. I
used to use USB to TTY converter so serial console configuration was needed. To
do that modfiy `config.txt` on boot partition of Raspbian with below entry and
end of file:

```
# Enable UART
enable_uart=1
```

Next you have to setup WiFi. Easiest way is through modification of
[wpa_supplicant.conf](https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/raspberry-pi-zerow-headless-wifi-setup.html).

Please note that `wpa_supplicant` is not started automatically without
additional configuration, so it is good to add below configuration to
`/etc/network/interfaces`:

```
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
```

After reboot your WiFi should be connected.

# Flashrom compilation

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flashrom
```

# Wiring

![rpizw_mb_wiring](http://3mdeb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rpizw_mb_wiring.jpg)

It is hard to explain that without nice drawing tool, but I will try with the
table and above picture:

|RPi Z W pin on J8 | MinnowBoard pin on J1 | wire color |
|---|---|---|
| Pin 1 - 3V3 OUT | Pin 1 - DDP_VCC| red |
| Pin 9 - GND | Pin 2 - GND| black |
| Pin 24 - SPI CS0 | Pin 3 - DDP_CS | green |
| Pin 23 - SPI SCLK | Pin 4 - DDP_CLK | blue |
| Pin 21 - SPI MISO | Pin 5 - DDP_MISO | orange |
| Pin 19 - SPI MOSI | Pin 6 - DDP_MOSI | yellow |

# Running flashrom read

```
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 -r mb.rom
```

It is good practice to read couple times and confirm that we reading the same
binary. We faced some problems when `HOLD#` and `WP#` were not pulled-up.

After reading, `binwalk` can be used to look inside binary:

```
sudo apt-get install binwalk
binwalk mb.rom

# Flashing coreboot binary

Easy way to bake coreboot binary is using our `coreboot-trainings-sdk`
container:

```
docker pull 3mdeb/coreboot-trainings-sdk:1.50
git clone https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot
cd coreboot
git submodule update --init --checkout
cd ..
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/coreboot:/home/coreboot/coreboot \
coreboot/coreboot-sdk:1.50 /bin/bash
cd ~/coreboot
make menuconfig
```

Choose mainboard vendor (Intel) and model (Minnow Max), then go to Chipset and
choose `Use Intel Firmware Support Pakcage`.

```
make -j$(nproc)
```

Then copy `coreboot/build/coreboot.rom` to Raspberry Pi and flash:

```
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 -w coreboot.rom
```

After reboot you should see:

```

```

# Stability issues

Above solution is low cost as well as low quality. A lot depends on quality of
wires. Probably well fitted connectors would save a lot of headache.

We also observed complains from flashrom:

```
Erasing and writing flash chip... FAILED at 0x00000010! Expected=0xff, Found=0x5a, failed byte count from 0x00000000-0x00000fff: 0xa5
ERASE FAILED!
Reading current flash chip contents... done. Looking for another erase function.
FAILED at 0x00000010! Expected=0xff, Found=0x5a, failed byte count from 0x00000000-0x00007fff: 0x260
ERASE FAILED!
```

This solution is also much slower, but if you need cheap alternative to SF100,
then some trade-offs have to be taken.

# Summary

I'm pretty sure that for most this is not new stuff, but we needed that post
refreshed for beginners as well as internal usage. It's good to have all
instructions in one place.
