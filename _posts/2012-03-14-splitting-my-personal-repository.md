After writing a few posts in which my workspace scripts could be useful, I 
realized that I should split blog works from the scripts that can be useful to 
others. From now materials related to the blog I will track in a separate 
repository and I'll add them as submodule into my environment. This implies that 
if we intend to deliver something to a broader audience this should include only 
those things which the recipient is expected and which we say that we provide. 
Any additional items should be removed. We get a lot of unwanted stuff today, at 
every opportunity. From an economic point of view, it is known that very often 
margin value law is used here i.e. by hypermarkets, I will touch on this subject 
on another occasion, related to economics.
