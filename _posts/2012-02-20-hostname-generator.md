Many times happened that I spend time, during the installation of the new system, whether it be a virtual physical machine, wondering about it's hostname. One day I asked myself the trouble searching for host name generator. Best I could find (currently second in the results of google) is rospo.net. It gives you the choice of category for the host name. My favorite, as a fan of fantasy is "Characters from Tolkien". Although the category name does not reflect the truth, because in addition also includes a set of known sites in middlearth and more. So I recommend: <http://rospo.net/webproducts/name/index.php>
