How mutt can handle mails in html format ? Takling about html mail handling is talking about handling any type of [Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions][1]. Mutt supports handling for all MIME types in one place for all programs. This place is `.mailcap` file. Googling a little bit I found below mailcap file configuration (kudos to [Bart Nagel][2]). 
    text/html; pandoc -f html -t markdown; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; test=type pandoc >/dev/null
    text/html;lynx -stdin -dump -force_html -width 70; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; test=type lynx >/dev/null
    text/html; w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 70; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; test=type w3m >/dev/null
    text/html; html2text -width 70; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; test=type html2text >/dev/null
     Of course we need to install all applications to make mailcap work correct: 

<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install pandoc lynx w3m html2text
</code></pre> To bring address book functionality to mutt we need abook application: 

<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install abook
</code></pre> Also few new line in 

`$HOME/.muttrc` will be needed: 
<pre><code class="bash"># add alias file for addresses
set alias_file=~/.mutt/alias source ~/.mutt/alias
# configure addressbook
set query_command= "abook --mutt-query '%s'"
macro index,pager A "&lt;pipe-message&gt;
abook --add-email-quiet&lt;return&gt;" "add the sender address to abook"
</code></pre> Adding new address simply create entry in alias file. During adding new alias abook asks about alias name, e-mail address, personal name and confirmation for given data. Some this fields could be filled automatically by interaction between abook and mutt. Of course file 

`$HOME/.mutt/alias` have to exist before running mutt: touch `$HOME/.mutt/alias` To access saved aliases simply click <tab> button in cc, to or bcc filed. There is few more options that I found useful. To find it please go to my [workspace][3] scripts at github. Also if you have any issues with the configuration or comments please let me know by commenting below the post.</tab>
