### Preface ###
There are many reasons why ambitious programmers should care about huge rush in 
embedded market. IMO there is great potential in it. I don't want to go deep into
this but take a look at all tablets, phones, smart TVs and other cool stuff 
like wireless in you washing machine or refrigerator (ok this two are right now only a gadgets :) ).
This is all embedded. Another thing is that wages of experienced embedded
developers are really high. 

This environment is very interesting. A lot to learn, a lot to do, so why not get 
your hands dirty ?

### First question: How to start ? ###
To do real embedded development, to learn the most, you simply buy hardware like
all this `${animal}board (animal={panda,beagle,hawk})`. This is the best way but 
if you're beginner (like me) you probably don't want to spend $50 for stuff that 
you throw away after month because you don't like to deal with it or problems 
are not on your level, than maybe you should take a look around and wonder if it
is possible to build virtual environment to check what kind of problem you may
encounter learning embedded ? BTW this is cheap and fun, so potential ROI is big 
enough to try.

IMHO this is where world going: proof of concept embedded platforms affordable
for common man (not only for US/West Europe), testing environment based on
virtualized/emulated solution, to check basic features, speed up testing, development
and deployment. That's why we see so active development of software like Qemu/KVM.

### Virtual Development Board - table of contents ###
I realize that it is achievable and I will learn a lot trying to implement this 
idea. Finally I was convinced reading [this](http://www.elinux.org/Virtual_Development_Board)
two years old article on [eLinux.org](http://www.elinux.org).

I decide to divide this article on few parts because IMHO it was to big to read
it at once. Also people interesting in particular topic won't have to scrolling `>2k`
words post. List of all articles in this series:

1. [Qemu as an environment for embedded board emulation](/2013/06/07/qemu-as-an-environment-for-embedded-board-emulation/)
2. [Toolchain for Virtual Development Board](/2013/06/07/toolchain-for-virtual-development-board/)
3. [Embedded board bootloader](/2013/06/07/embedded-board-bootloader/)
4. [Linux kernel for embedded system](/2013/06/07/linux-kernel-for-embedded-system/)
5. [Qemu network configuration and tftp for Virtual Development Board](/2013/06/07/qemu-network-configuration-and-tftp-for-virtual-development-board/)
6. [Root file system for embedded system](/2013/06/07/root-file-system-for-embedded-system/)

### Kudos ###

At the and of this intro I want to give big kudos to all those hackers without 
whom creating this article would not be possible. Thanks for sharing your 
knowledge. Every time when I use knowledge that found by googling I'm trying
to stick link for further reading.
