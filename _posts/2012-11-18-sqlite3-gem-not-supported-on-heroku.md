When I tried to deploy second part of [RoR tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top)
to Heroku I get this error:
```
An error occurred while installing sqlite3 (1.3.5), and Bundler cannot continue.  
Make sure that `gem install sqlite3 -v '1.3.5'` succeeds before bundling.
!
!  Failed to install gems via Bundler.
!
! Detected sqlite3 gem which is not supported on Heroku.
!  http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-do-i-use-sqlite3-for-development
!
!  Heroku push rejected, failed to compile Ruby/rails app
To git@heroku.com:thawing-beyond-7283.git 
! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@heroku.com:thawing-beyond-7283.git'
```
I searched a little bit about this error and find [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3747002/heroku-rails-3-and-sqlite3)
stackoverflow post. But when I look more carefully on the Gemfile syntax I
found a mistake. I used simply:
```ruby
gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.5'
```
But I should have:
```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.5'
end
group :production do
  gem 'pg', '0.12.2'
end
```
As RoR tutorial states.
