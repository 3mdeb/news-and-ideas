### Introduction This is probably the most complicated topic of all related to embedded development but we need to deal with it at the beginning. I read a lot about toolchains but still don't know enough to explain details. I think that best answers are in crosstool-ng 

[documentation][8]. <a id="what-is-toolchain"></a> 
### What is toolchain ?

*Toolchain* as the name said is a set of tools chained together, so output of one tool is the input for different tool. This is well known concept in Linux (eg. pipes). In embedded environment toolchain is called cross-toolchain or cross-compiler, because usually it compiles on one architecture and generate code for another (eg. it compiles on x86 and generate code for arm)[[1]][9]. <a id="why-we-need-cross-toolchain"></a> 
### Why we need cross-toolchain ? I suspect that your laptop/PC is not based on ARM processor, most probably it based on x86 architecture so you cannot simply compile code and run it in our virtual-arm-based environment. To prepare operating system and tools for it we need cross-toolchain. 

<a id="how-to-create-toolchain"></a> 
### How to create toolchain ? Process of creating cross-toolchain from scratch is not easy and takes some time. There are few other ways to get toolchain, than creating it from scratch. First we can use prebuilt toolchain providers like: 

`CodeSourcery`, `Linaro`, `DENX 
EDLK` or `Emdebian`. Second we can create toolchain using special building system like: `Buildroot`, `Crosstool-NG` or `Bitbake`. I will not deal with preparing toolchain in this series because procedure for creating it takes pretty long. So we have two options: 
*   read my article about [Crosstool-NG arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi][10]
*   or install toolchain ready to use like [Emdebian][11]

<a id="emdebian-path"></a> 
#### Emdebian path Add below lines to you 

`/etc/apt/sources.list`: 
<pre><code class="bash">deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/emdebian/toolchains unstable main
</code></pre> Install Emdebian keys, update and install cross-compiler with all related packages: 

<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install emdebian-archive-keyring
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabi
</code></pre>

##### Dependency problems during installation If above attempt to install cross-compiler ends with: 

    pietrushnic@eglarest:~/src$ sudo apt-get install gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabi
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
    or been moved out of Incoming.
    The following information may help to resolve the situation:
    
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabi : Depends: libgomp1-armel-cross (>= 4.7.2-5) but it 
     is not going to be installed
     E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
     This means that Debian ustable cross-compiler is not available for you configuration. You can read more about that 

[here][12]. To fix that issue simply change emdebian toochain repository to testing in `/etc/apt/source.list`: 
    deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/emdebian/toolchains testing main
    

##### Emdebian toolchain configuration Check where 

`arm-linux-eabi-gcc-4.7` was installed: 
<pre><code class="bash">whereis arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.7
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4: /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.7 /usr/bin/X11/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.7
</code></pre> It is not linked to 

`arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc`, so we cannot give its prefix as `CROSS_COMPILE` variable value, which is needed for bootloader and kernel compilation. We have to link it to `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc`: 
<pre><code class="bash">sudo ln -s /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.7 /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc
</code></pre> Toolchain is ready to use. 

*Note*: I tried `CodeSourcery` toolchain `arm-2012.09-64-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.bin`, but it contain `binutils` defect that not allow correctly build kernel. If you see something like this in log: 
    Error: selected processor does not support ARM mode `ldralt lr,[r1],#4'
     That means you experience same thing, please use 

`Emdebian` or `Crosstool-NG` toolchain. *Note 2*: If you're `Ubuntu` user I have to suggest experiments with toolchain build by your own, because I get really hard times trying to go through this tutorial with Ubuntu/Linaro cross compiler provided in repository. Finally I used [this][10] to push things forward. U-boot compiled with Ubuntu/Linaro toolchain had problem with `__udivsi3` instruction. This cause loop in initialization process. <a id="summary"></a> 
### Summary If you take effort of creating toolchain using 

`Crosstool-NG` than congratulations. But for simplifying whole [**Virtual Development Board**][13] series I will use `Emdebian` toolchain in further posts. Of course you can use your brand new `Crosstool-NG` toolchain by simply remember that tools prefixes are different. `Emdebian` uses `arm-linux-gnueabi-` and `Crosstool-NG` was created with `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-`. Replace one with another every time when needed. In [next post][14] we will deal with bootloader. <a id="kudos"></a>
